PremierLeague,"The front of a football jersey is a huge get for an advertiser. Millions of fans worldwide become walking billboards for your brand. You would think that all the big advertisers would be battling for these spots. But instead, these highly coveted avails are often won by relatively small names.

I first noticed this a few years ago when Atletico Madrid, the 12th most valuable club in the world, had “Visit Azerbaijan” on the front of their kits. And I got to thinking: How did the Azerbaijan tourist association outbid companies like Coca Cola and Procter &amp; Gamble and Amazon and Samsung for this opportunity? Unless these big companies aren’t even trying to get on the front of a football jersey. 

Across Europe, I think only Man United, Brighton, and Bayern have shirt sponsors that are among the conventional “big advertisers” globally. A lot of clubs have betting companies, which I suppose makes sense. But when Palace went with W88, they really didn’t receive any better offers from bigger companies? 

I live in NYC and I saw someone wearing a West Brom shirt with “Ideal Boilers” across the front the other day. I see Dortmund shirts all the time with 1&amp;1 on it (1&amp;1 one is a relatively small web hosting company.) There are more Everton fans who live outside of Cazoo’s service area than inside—I don’t think Cazoo will ship a car to Thailand or Texas or South Africa. And that’s not to mention all the people around the globe who see the shirts on TV every week.

Bottom line is: I can’t imagine Ideal Boilers or 1&amp;1 spent very much to get these deals and I’m just wondering why Sony or Verizon or Chase or any of the other big spenders didn’t spend a dollar more to outbid these small companies to get a pretty desirable spot.

So two questions:

* When clubs agree to a shirt sponsorship with a small company, are they not receiving any better offers from bigger companies?
* If not then… why not? These spots should be garnering huge interest from the world’s biggest advertisers. Why isn’t this the case?",t2_1c0fq32l,Football shirt sponsors are often relatively small companies. Why is this?,t3_kwjtbr,pi_west,105,"Football shirt sponsors are often relatively small companies.

PremierLeague,"
Olé’s selection of Pogba and Matic, designed to give MUFC the quality to play through Burnley, whilst maintaining strong physical presence, was a brilliant decision. The inclusion of Matic was carefully made to allow United to drop into a back 3 in build up, giving numerical superiority over Burnley’s 2 STs when they applied pressure. The idea was that Shaw and AWB would push on, however, early on, United found it hard to pick a pass through the lines from the back 3, or back into the centre when we went wide through the FBs.

Martial and Shaw together on the left was another interesting call - Martial was instructed to play very narrow, alongside Cavani to drive at defenders, making use of any space in between the Burnley defence and midfield. Shaw held the width by overlapping, and did a decent job.

Sean Dyche was evidently aware of United’s ball progression issues, and so tasked his CMs with going man to man on Pogba and Fernandes early on, to make it hard for United to pick out a forward pass. It was effective, however, on occasions where Pogba dropped deeper and to the left, and Bruno went higher and to the right, a large gap opened between the Burnley central midfielders - it was frustrating that none of United’s forwards dropped into this space to receive the ball. This could’ve created some great chances, as one simple pass would’ve bypassed the Burnley attack and midfield, leaving our attackers driving at their defence!

In the second half, Burnley appeared to tire, and the spaces between the lines were much greater, allowing United’s quality players to get time and space on the ball. Nemanja Matic was instrumental here. Rather than dropping into the back 3 like in the first half, he realised that he’d be more valuable higher up - maintaining United’s midfield overload of 3v2 against the Burnley CMs. Whether this was discussed at HT, or an on field decision from Matic, it was fantastic and hugely helpful for United, both to sustain attacks and to minimise Burnley counters.

Defensively, Burnley tried to target AWB at the far post, since he has a clear tendency to lose his man/ get caught underneath the ball. They played crosses and long balls towards AWB’s zone, AND doubled up on him, sending both Brady and Pieters forward to overload his zone at times. United did a great job to come away with a clean sheet, and hang on for the victory.

PremierLeague,"Newcastle seem to love dropping points against record-breakingly bad sides! Here are some of their most notable failures to notch a single point across a season against easy opposition:

2007/08 vs Derby: 1D 1L 2G 3GA 
Derby picked up 4 of their 11 points and scored 15% of their total goals in their 2 fixtures against Newcastle that season. A 1-0 win 6-weeks in to pick up their first 3 points turned out to be their only win of the season, although it was only a late equaliser from Mark Viduka that saved Newcastle from more embarrassment in their home fixture in December!

2015/16 vs Villa: 2D 1G 1GA
Picking up these points against a side that lost over 70% of their games would've saved Newcastle from the drop... and sent down bitter rivals Sunderland instead! Costly

2019/20 vs Norwich: 1D 1L 1G 3GA
Over a tenth of their goals and almost a fifth of Norwich's points coming against Newcastle? In all fairness it was a fine hat trick from an on-fire Teemu Pukki that sunk the magpies this time round.

PremierLeague,"So I’m a huge Manchester United fan and my dad is a huge Manchester City fan. He got me into soccer as a young kid and we’ve always dreamt of going to the UK at least once in our lives to watch the legendary derby together. (Forgot to mention we live in the USA)

Today, my dad was diagnosed with a malignant glioma (brain cancer) and we found out that he might not have much longer. 

The next derby is at Etihad stadium on March 6th. This may very well be the last possibility that we ever have to enjoy such a once in a lifetime opportunity.

I have some money saved up, I’ve already looked up flights and I can afford everything. The only problem I have is getting the tickets. It seems that you can’t just buy them anywhere but I’d be willing to pay any amount I just really need some help maybe from someone who has tickets or a way to get them.

Thanks and please let me know ASAP so I can plan. I really want to make this happen so we can have the memory.

PremierLeague," At 0:30 am on January 18, the first Double Red Cross Society of the 20-21 season is about to start. Liverpool will play Manchester United at the home stadium at Anfield.  

Regarding the significance of the Double Reds, I believe fans will understand: Since the first Double Reds on April 28, 1894, the battle between Liverpool and Manchester United has lasted 127 years. This is the confrontation between the two teams that have won the most championships in England's top league. Manchester United won 20 championships and Liverpool won 19 championships. And the famous Red Devils coach Ferguson's famous statement explains the relationship between the two clubs very clearly: ""The greatest achievement of my life is that TMD has pulled Liverpool off the championship!""  

More importantly, this season's double Red Club match is the first time in the Premier League's 28-year history that Liverpool and Manchester United have ranked first and second. After all, since the Premier League era, Liverpool has been in a downturn during the Manchester United dynasty; and when Liverpool has been in the dust in the past two seasons, Manchester United can only fight for the Champions League qualification. The heydays of the two teams are always staggered, but even in the Manchester United dynasty, Liverpool had a 4-1 away record of beating Manchester United away; and in the first half of last season, Liverpool’s ""people blocked killing, Buddha blocked the Buddha"". At that time, only Manchester United scored 1 point on them.",t2_76umsyb7,"The most exciting Double Red Cross Society in 28 years, who are you more optimistic about?",t3_kwbz0k,win-goal,2,"The most exciting Double Red Cross Society in 28 years, who are you more optimistic about?

PremierLeague,"So Reguillon (and Lamela, Lanzini and Lo Celso) all broke the lockdown rules by having a party on Christmas Day). Now just approx 2 weeks later Reguillon has assisted the possibly winning goal in the EFL Cup SF. For doing something illegal he has been fined by Spurs but nothing else has happened.

Given how Cavani was fined £100,000 and banned for 3 games because he said one word that was deemed inappropriate, why is it that a group of players can break the UK and the biggest punishment they face is a fine that is likely what they earn in a week or even less.

Surely a 3, 5 or even 10 match ban would be suitable for breaking COVID rules otherwise loads of players will continue to do it and potentially stop the pl because they could be spreading COVID to all teams.

PS: I know that as a Brentford fan that I’m biased but if Ivan Toney or any of our best players went out I would be criticising them for it and I wouldn’t change my mindset.


Edit: I didn’t account on getting this many replies so I’ll address the main points that people are saying:

-I completely forgot about Walker and obviously the same principle should be applied to him.

-I thought that it was bad on behalf of the FA before the match for letting Reguillon with no punishment (aside from one issued by Spurs) and I made this post after he assisted a goal because I saw the irony in this.

Given how Cavani was fined £100,000 and banned for 3 games because he said one word that was deemed inappropriate, why is it that a group of players can break the UK and the biggest punishment they face is a fine that is likely what they earn in a week or even less.

Surely a 3, 5 or even 10 match ban would be suitable for breaking COVID rules otherwise loads of players will continue to do it and potentially stop the pl because they could be spreading COVID to all teams.

PS: I know that as a Brentford fan that I’m biased but if Ivan Toney or any of our best players went out I would be criticising them for it and I wouldn’t change my mindset.


Edit: I didn’t account on getting this many replies so I’ll address the main points that people are saying:

-I completely forgot about Walker and obviously the same principle should be applied to him.

-I thought that it was bad on behalf of the FA before the match for letting Reguillon with no punishment (aside from one issued by Spurs) and I made this post after he assisted a goal because I saw the irony in this.

Adding to this, I have a question:

When, exactly, is the balled considered as being kicked? 

I suppose it is the moment the ball leaves the kicker's foot?

PremierLeague,"So I've spent most of this season so far looking at ways to quantify how much teams have improved/worsened since last season as a way of analysing performance. I had gotten very tired with the general approach of saying ""x team had this many points at this stage last season!"" because that doesn't factor in any way, the order that the fixtures have come in. For example, West Ham started this season with an incredibly difficult run of fixtures and that should have been reflected in any comparisons to performance from last season early on.

Anyhow, this is what I've arrived at thus far.

The algorithm for deciding the final number takes in a lot of different factors ranging from performance, outcome and result data points. I'm always updating it so the table is often being rebalanced but those changes are usually incredibly subtle and affect the final numbers by small amounts.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and for some discussion to be sparked by this. What makes Southampton come out so low for example?

PremierLeague,"A lot of people including me will say yes to this question. Henderson and Fabinho are playing as their CB's and they are missing the flair in the midfield. Who would they sign

SAMUEL GIGOT
Samuel Gigot is a French CB from Spartak Moscow who is 6'3"" and 27 years of age. Spartak are 3rd after 19 games (10/5/4) with 21 goals conceded which is 1.10 goals conceded per game. Gigot has also popped up with 3 goals in the Russian League and could be a half decent mid-term signing. Liverpool have also conceded 21 goals this season but in 2 less games which is 1.23 goals conceded per game. Based off stats, Gigot would be a great addition

JEROME BOATENG

PremierLeague,"**Arsenal: David Alaba**. This might be a bit unrealistic, but Alaba is most likely leaving Bayern. If Arsenal can beat Real and others to the player, he would massively improve Arsenal in the form of a center back and being great cover in defensive midfield and at left back, with Tierney and Ceballos both massively underperforming this season, although Tierney has had a few decent games recently. Another option might be Maximillian Arnold, a great midfielder with the capabilities to execute Arteta's vision

**Aston Villa: Jack Harrison**. I hate this fact because I'm a Leeds fan, but a front line consisting of Harrison, Watkins, and Grealish would be arguably the best front 3 outside of the big 6. Harrison is a quality playmaker who can bring what Ross Barkley doesn't bring, and therefore push Aston Villa to do better.

**Brighton: Joao Moutinho**. Brighton right now are a team that, under the right leadership, could actually surprise a few people. A decent defense, decent attack, but a midfield which could use a lot of reinforcement. It's not like Potter doesn't have them playing good football, for example Tariq Lamptey's goal against Spurs (which should not have stood), but Adam Lallana isn't the best creative base for a team gunning for mid table security. Moutinho might not have age on his side, but he's definitely a player that can improve Brighton. A little work on patching up the defense would be useful as well, although that's more a tactical problem than a technical one.

**Burnley: Eddie Howe**. For an actual suggestion though, **Josh King** would add some much needed pace and tooth into a very poor attacking team. Still won't change anything if Dyche tries to make Dwight McNeil dribble the ball from his penalty area to the midfield line then boot it forwards to the attack, but Burnley fans can pray,

**Chelsea: Raphaël Guerreiro**. In my post a few days ago, I preached the importance of not signing big name players who only are that big because they scored 2 penalties and a tap-in to bring their team to the UCL quarter finals before a ""tragic"" 6-1 aggregate loss to Bayern where the player didn't even touch the ball once. Guerreiro actually has talent, something rare in a signing worth over 10m in the EPL. He's proven his abilities at Dortmund, and with Chillwell flopping, he's an escape route. Right now, I'm not sure he's the best signing. Try out Chillwell, and if not him then Marcos Alonso. But if Chillwell is a certifiable flop, Guerreiro is a talent proven by years of hard work at a big club.

**Crystal Palace: Divock Origi**. Any striker worth more than 5m would be a lifesaver for this club. Wilfried Zaha and Eze are being drowned by the lack of playmakers and strikers around them, or at least quality ones. Luka Milojevic works decently in the midfield, Guaita at the back, but you need 2 strikers to run a 4-4-2 system, and I'm only seeing one. Origi isn't the worst striker, although definitely overhyped by Liverpool fans, so why not him? Other options are Salomon Rondon, Arkadiusz Milik, and Jamie Tartt (don't look him up the show will probably make any proper englishman want to die but everybody else finds it nice).

**Everton: Christian Eriksen**. He's played terribly at Inter. He has absolutely no justification playing at a good team again. But Everton do need a decent deep lying playmaker to complement James, DCL, and Richarlison (amongst others). Eriksen is a definite outside option for it. He would definitely be a great player for Ancelotti to have and experiment with, and can change Everton for the better if he returns to his Spurs form.

**Fulham: Pablo Fornals**. Outside option, definitely. But if Fulham can get him, he would inject the midfield with some quality. Lookman isn't the best in the world at penalties, Mitrovic hasn't been clinical, but the midfield is arguably the absolute worst in the Premier League. Fornals would be a realistic, cheap option who could actually help them.

**Leeds United: Igor Zubeldia**. I didn't want to be unoriginal and just say Puig, so I went with Zubeldia.  He's not necessarily a replacement for Phillips or a center back, more as a player who can play anywhere in that region to compensate for the insane amount of injuries they've been picking up.

**Leicester City: Troy Parrot**. Spurs will be reluctant to let him up, but there's no question that Vardy's getting older. That isn't to say Vardy is no longer Premier League quality: I would still call him top 10 strikers in the league if not top 5. However, it isn't wise to rest your hopes on a 33 year old. My suggestion is to sign Parrot and maybe another more proven striker and develop them while Vardy can still work as their first choice to have a good backup in good time.

**Liverpool: Dayot Upamecano**. Good center back to cover for the injuries. If not a purchase then a loan with option to buy. Pretty simple.

**Man City: Kingsley Coman**. Goals needed. Goalscorer of UCL winning goal and treble winner. Outside shot, could become excellent under Pep. If he doesn't instantly take to the EPL though expect many ""flop"" messages.

**Man United: James Justin**. The easy choice for this would be a Pogba replacement. However, I personally think Donny van de Beek is the best option to replace him. James Justin is an outside shot for the left back position, which definitely needs reinforcement with Luke Shaw being the only/best option there. Brandon Williams is nothing compared to Justin, who's had a decent season at Leicester.

**Newcastle United: Ben White**. If Ashley actually opens his wallet for the first time in millenia (barring last summer), Ben White could reinforce the back line at Newcastle to push them even further from the relegation zone. Could cost them upwards of 30m, so a cheaper option may be needed

**Sheffield United: Juan Mata**. This would be a desperate signing without a doubt, but it might actually work. If Wilder can stomach changing to a new system and allowing Mata to be their main playmaker, it might not leave them last. Not saying they would survive, but Mata is a realistic signing who could provide some temporary relief or at the very least a win.

**Southampton: Sergio Romero**. Not to say that Southampton's goalkeepers are not EPL quality, but to be up at the top they need a stronger goalie. Romero doesn't instantly come to mind, but the stats back him to be the best backup goalie in practically the world.

**Spurs: Julian Weigl**. He is the perfect Mourinho player. He can work in the midfield or at the back, young but old enough to be in his prime, and would be perfect cover at Spurs for Alderweireld and Hojberg. 

**West Brom: Olivier Giroud**. Unlikely. But West Brom need a good striker desperately and Lampard's delusions about Tammy at striker and Werner at the wing means it could actually be done. Goals are needed and he can provide them.

**West Ham: John Brooks**. Not particularly great, but a good center back to keep West Ham from conceding goals, which would be much appreciated considering their lack of effective center backs.

**Wolves: Thilo Kehrer**. Seeing Kilman at CB is great considering my widespread condemnation of it (youth talents getting efficient game time) not happening enough, but it also means it's the easiest spot for me to improve so I'm going to be a hypocrite just this once and any other time I see fit. Thilo Kehrer has flown under the radar of impressive young talents, not seeming out of place at one of the biggest teams in Europe. Kilman could definitely still develop and maybe even compete with Kehrer, but either way an improvement would be made.

Can't wait to see how hard I get slammed for this",t2_3x3og8tw,The player every team should sign,t3_kqjp2o,Versigot,29,"The player every team should sign **Arsenal: David Alaba**. This might be a bit unrealistic, but Alaba is most likely leaving Bayern. If Arsenal can beat Real and others to the player, he would massively improve Arsenal in the form of a center back and being great cover in defensive midfield and at left back, with Tierney and Ceballos both massively underperforming this season, although Tierney has had a few decent games recently. Another option might be Maximillian Arnold, a great midfielder with the capabilities to execute Arteta's vision

**Aston Villa: Jack Harrison**. I hate this fact because I'm a Leeds fan, but a front line consisting of Harrison, Watkins, and Grealish would be arguably the best front 3 outside of the big 6. Harrison is a quality playmaker who can bring what Ross Barkley doesn't bring, and therefore push Aston Villa to do better.

**Brighton: Joao Moutinho**. Brighton right now are a team that, under the right leadership, could actually surprise a few people. A decent defense, decent attack, but a midfield which could use a lot of reinforcement.

When theres a problem at a football club, you dont just point fingers at the manager unless if hes actually the problem. Is the most decorated manager in history the problem?

PremierLeague,"Ik I'm an Arsenal fan but mine would be:

Arteta Ole Lampard

&amp;#x200B;

Arteta first cuz he won 2 trophies in 8 months unlike the other two who have none. Arsenal was internally and morally chaotic when he first took charge as well. He also has the best H2H record amongst the two managers(vs Ole: 2 meetings WW.  vs Lampard: 4 meetings LDWW). Also for some extra icing, Arteta has a better win record against Klopp than anyone listed(4 meetings WWLW). That's pretty good for someone who only managed a team for 10 months(that's when Arteta last met Klopp) in his managerial career.

&amp;#x200B;

Ole second cuz although he doesn't have any silverware he is currently 2nd place in the prem, placing better than Arteta and Lampard currently. He also got United to 3rd last season with a masterclass signing of Bruno(what a player)

&amp;#x200B;

Lampard last place by a mile cuz his only decent achievement was reaching the FA cup final and finishing 4th last season in the league. He spent 250M to sit 8th. Arteta and Ole would most likely perform better if they got that sort of backing.

PremierLeague,"For example, Werner. He scored 28 goals last season in a system built for him. You could see a large amount of his goals coming from his breakaway abilities. Meanwhile, Lampard has him playing as a left winger half the time. He doesn't have the same effect, even if he has the attributes for it. Havertz is being talked about being a flop as well, even though he's been injured half the time and not performed all too poorly in general. This has been happening for a while, with Morata and Keita and so many others at other teams. Just because you have one good season doesn't mean you have the best passing range in Europe. Just because you work well in one system in one league doesn't mean the same is true for another system in another league. People should stop complaining when a player isn't instantly the best at their team when they were hyping up their potential instead of their abilities. This has happened time and time again. 

Instead of signing your Havertzs and Werners and Moratas who have just had a great season under a different system, instead consider signing somebody like Mendy who has a proven track record outside of media attention. Somebody like Luuk de Jong could probably score 10+ EPL goals a season but he's not talked about because he hasn't played for a ""big team"" yet even though he has a Europa League title under his belt. Julian Weigl could probably act as a midfield pivot for any team outside of the biggest few, but he's not talked about because he didn't ""reach his potential"" at Dortmund. Wout Weghorst hasn't been talked about at all in footballing circles even though he's led his team by scoring 9 in 13 in the Bundesliga, and is now starting to see some transfer rumors to Spurs. Let me predict what his career will be like if he makes this move: He'll join them, be unable to break through the Kane-Son dynamic, be called a ""flop"" because he scored once in the 5 games he was provided since Troy Parrot received more attention than him, build his career back at the age of 30 in a different league or at a lower level team like Crystal Palace, and eventually will be known as ""that guy who flopped at Spurs"" even though his career was so much bigger than that.

Why are they able to get away with it? Is that the only way to get a foul call in the Prem now? Is it on the refs? Is it on the players for being soft and going to ground way too easily?

PremierLeague,"It's Mourinho's inability to recognise a problem on the pitch if it concerns his favourite players. Kane and Son should not have played that much. Or at all tbh. They've both looked increasingly poorer and slower recently, they clearly need a rest. Vinicius has done a job in Europa. Lamela, Moura and Bergwijn can do jobs on the wings. Alli can do a job as a second striker. They had no choice but to defend for 90 minutes because the attack was so poor. If that was Dele Alli playing like that he'd have come off in the first half.

As soon as Ndombele went off they had no chance. He's the only one that could hold up a ball up there. What was the point of not playing him at all against Leicester when they actually needed him, for him to only play 60 minutes again tonight?

Kane and Son should not have played that much. Or at all tbh. They've both looked increasingly poorer and slower recently, they clearly need a rest. Vinicius has done a job in Europa. Lamela, Moura and Bergwijn can do jobs on the wings. Alli can do a job as a second striker. They had no choice but to defend for 90 minutes because the attack was so poor. If that was Dele Alli playing like that he'd have come off in the first half.

As soon as Ndombele went off they had no chance. He's the only one that could hold up a ball up there. What was the point of not playing him at all against Leicester when they actually needed him, for him to only play 60 minutes again tonight?

PremierLeague,"Who’ve been your signings of the season for PL clubs? In no particular order, mine go...

Gabriel (Arsenal) - Currently looks like Arsenal’s only competent defender, you’d shudder to imagine  where they’d be without him. 

Watkins (Villa) - Really great all around striker, strong, fast and a great finisher on the ground or in the air. Spearheads Villa’s attack better than Wesley or Samatta and looks a menace whenever he’s on the pitch. 

Torres (City) - Really young, great fee and looks like becoming a star already under Guardiola. 

Martinez (Villa) - Villa’s unsung hero this season and maybe the most consistent shot-stopper in the league behind Alisson, Martinez makes you wonder why Chelsea didn’t go for him over Mendy. 

Allan (Everton) - The perfect anchor to a midfield containing more attacking options and one of the best DMs in Europe for almost 5 years, all for less than €30m. Only nitpick is his age, but for such a low fee he still makes it in. 

Lookman (Fulham) - Has looked absolutely electric for Fulham this season. Seemed underwhelming as a loan deal, but at this rate Fulham and every club in England should be vying to get him out of Leipzig this Summer. Huge key pass and dribble numbers and bear in mind that he’s still only 23. 

Fofana (Leicester) - Huge fee but for a 19-year old I don’t think anyone could have expected him to slot straight in to a top-4 challenging defense. Really astute signing shows that Leicester have still got it when looking for incredibly talented youth. 

Jota (Liverpool) - 12 goals and 2 assists in under 1200 league/UCL/cup minutes. Liverpool are lucky they didn’t go for Ismaila Sarr instead. 

Thiago (Liverpool) - Not had much of a chance to show it yet, but the best midfielder in the world for €30m is an unreal bargain. 

Hojbjerg (Spurs) - Exactly what Spurs needed in the midfield. Hojbjerg adds some steel to a midfield commonly criticized for being soft, as well as a great range of passing and an assured touch when in possession. When you consider that the deal basically works out to €3m + Kyle Walker-Peters, it’s a slam dunk. 

Coufal (West Ham) - The second acquisition from Slavia Prague in as many windows, Coufal’s strength and defensive mettle makes you wonder what other bargains are there to be had outside of Europe’s top 5 leagues.

Thiago Silva (Chelsea) - Added in by popular demand and due to the fact I completely overlooked him, Silva has provided maturity and stability to a young Chelsea side for the low cost of his wages.",t2_8408njnn,Signings of the Season,t3_kl1arr,Correct_Elk4767,42,"Signings of the Season Who’ve been your signings of the season for PL clubs?

PremierLeague,"I include realistically because while we would all love to sign Van Dijk Neuer Lewandowski Ronaldo and Ramos, that might be a bit of a stretch 😅

As a city fan, after watching most of our games this season, especially the last couple, it seems straightforward enough. We need someone who can finish chances with 100% consistency. Sterling Torres Mahrez Bernardo are all phenomenal players but in their instinct, as wingers who often assist, they can’t be called upon to finish chances as much as we need.

PremierLeague,"I love Frank Lampard and he's my second favorite player of all time behind Didier Drogba. I have wanted him to succeed this whole time and still do. Nothing would make me happier than him succeeding as manager and Chelsea winning the league with him. However, as a lifelong Chelsea fan I will always put the success of my club first. Multiple players mentioned that they chose to come to Chelsea due to Frank Lampard being here (Werner, Havertz and even Haaland said something along those lines). I believe he did a great job last year making it to the FA Cup Final (we should have won that) and finishing in the Top 4 with a transfer ban. We spent 250+ million this summer on absolutely brilliant players (Werner = 2 most goal contributions in Bundesliga, Havertz = one of the most highly touted young players in the world, Ziyech = someone who should have come to the Prem long ago, Chilwell = a top left back in the Prem, Mendy = stop gap goalkeeper and Silva = aging but still top level CB). We came into this season knowing that the plan was to close the gap on Liverpool and Man City this season and have top 4 and trophy as a BARE MINIMUM. We started this season with Kepa in goal and struggled even though we were playing teams that should not cause us problems (outside of Liverpool of course). Me and other fans made excuses about Kepa's mistakes and injuries against West Brom, Southampton and Liverpool. We went on a 17 game unbeaten streak while performing well in Europe and everyone was gassed up and claiming we were realistic title challengers and potentially UCL winners. Meanwhile nobody realized that none of the teams we beat were in the top 10 of the league. Then we had a shocker against Everton and Wolves, which in my opinion exposed the weakness of Lampard's tactics. We consistently play Timo on the wing (he's not a fucking winger and sucks there.. it's plain for everyone to see), we haven't played Kai in the correct position all season (he's a 10) and we INSIST on crossing the ball when we play Tammy up top (who can't win a header for his life.. look at the Spurs, Krasnodar, Arsenal games). Lampard's substitutions also make absolutely no sense, we didn't bring on Giroud when he's not only on form but also all we're doing is crossing for example (34 crosses, he also had Timo, Tammy and Giroud all on the field at the same time in one game). He also played a 50% Reece James and Ben Chilwell who were injured when we have a proven albeit aging RB in Azpi (our club captain btw) and Emerson who played absolutely fine against West Ham. He brought on Jorginho who doesn't progress the ball and played poor against West Ham as well. We are 15 points behind where we were at this point last season as well.

PremierLeague,"Now, I know what you are thinking - just pick the best 18, right? Well, not necessarily. I can choose a heavily attacking side with Sterling, Mahrez, Salah, Rashford, Mane, Bruno, Son and Kane, but is this team realistically outscoring the opponent for 38 games? No, there needs to be some strategy into choosing the best all-around team. Plus, for the sake of it being more interesting, you gotta think about non-quantifiable factors like - who will be the big start, who will be pulling the strings in the midfield, are you gonna pick very offensive wing backs and if yes - maybe a CDM extra to cover the spaces behind them?   


Rules for participating:

* **Max 3 players per team -** the idea is not to pick Liverpool's team and add De Bryune and Maguire (haha)
* **Pick the formation you want -** 3-4-3, 4-4-2, anything you would like to play 
* **It's based on players right now, not their potential -** picking a team of the Lampteys, Curtis Joneses and Pedro Netos of the world would be fun but realistically they are not breaking the record 

No more rules - let's play! 

**Starting 11:**

1. **GK - Alisson -** Alisson wins us 15 points by himself, just making those 1 or 2 sensational saves per game that keep us in a game/save us a tight game. Very easy choice. 
2. **RB - Kyle Walker -** provides defensive stability, can play as the right CB in a back three and on offence can still produce, albeit not as much as Trent Alexander Arnold. Walker is the man for the right.
3. **CB - Conor Coady -** I will never not say that he is one of the best CBs in the league. In a back 4 they could be sensational.
4. **CB - Virgil Van Dijk -** I mean, when he's playing he is the best CB in the world. Remember, people were saying he was better than Messi. That's insane for a defender.
5. **LB - Ben Chilwell -** this season for Chelsea he was even better than last year, capable on the back and as dangerous as ever on the front.
6. **CDM - N'Golo Kante -** having infront of these 4 basically locks my defence. It's unplayable - Kante's there and then if you pass by him you face a wall. These defence alone is getting 27 to 30 clean sheets. 
7. **CM - Paul Pogba -** not only Kante locks the defence, but he unlocks Pogba. Example? Look no further than World Cup 2018 where Pogba and Kante played together and we all saw what happened. 
8. **CM - Kevin De Bryune -** basically have De Bryune be the more offensive midfielder out of the three.
9. **RW - Mohamed Salah -** for me Salah is the second best player in the Premier League and the best right wing in the world. Look at his numbers - since joining Liverpool probably only Messi and Lewa have more goals than him. 
10. **LW - Heung-Min Son -** what can I say - he is different. With these passers he gets three, four chances per game and with his ratio of goals/shots, that guarantees goals.
11. **ST - Jamie Vardy -** I know Harry Kane plays in the PL, but again, with this passing Vardy will get so many chances. He is also way better in a possession play than people think.

**Reserves:**

1. **Nick Pope -** so underrated. Nick Pope filling in for Alisson sounds like a dream.
2. **Thiago Silva -** the idea of Silva being on the bench is that he is quite old so I don't want him to play every game. Rotate the starting two, start every other game. When he plays he is always dominant. 
3. **Reece James -** perfect choice from the bench to give Walker some air. 
4. **Jack Grealish -** someone parked the bus against us, it's 75th minute and it's 0-0, what do we do? Easy, put Grealish in and he will find the gap in the opponent's defence.
5. **Raheem Sterling -** Son terrorized the opponent's right back in the first half, he is tired and has a yellow. And now he will defend against a well-rested Sterling for 45 minutes! Yikes.
6. **Harry Kane -** this bench is making me feel anxious for the other side. Kane from the bench? What?
7. **Wilfried Ndidi -** Kante will cover a lot for the attacking players and he needs to have a player coming off the bench to cover for him.

With this my side is finished. In a normal game you have De Bryune and Pogba pushing balls forward to the three speedsters and if the opponent parks the bus, you can put Grealish in to empty pockets, Sterling to make them uncomfortable and Harry Kane to annihilate.

PremierLeague,"I'll be honest, I now try to avoid anything on twitter specifically, but also media response to Leeds matches as a whole. While it's nice to watch the praise for wins, some of the opinions and views of pundits, fans of other teams and even Leeds fans, just hurt my head. So I wanted to put my honest views on everything Leeds related, just to see what other Leeds fans think, if anyone agrees/disagrees, but also what other fans of other teams think.

To start with, in all honesty the expectation from the media for Leeds this season took me by surprise. Sure, we play exciting football, and having watched it for over 2 years it's become normal though I'm reminded watching other team's games how good the football is (don't get me wrong, losing is still losing and not a great feeling, but as for the quality of football and excitement when I watch, it's great), but that doesn't mean we'll be a team challenging for Europe like I saw at the start of the season.From all honest Leeds fans (because we all have those crazy fans), our aim is, and always has been the same as any promoted from Championship. Survival. I'm not in a dream world as to the relaity of what we should expect to achieve as a team. I would take a goal difference survival, a couple points survival, hell, even a goal line technology malfunction survival (Just a joke Villa fans, nothing serious). After 16 years out of the Prem, where it was looking more and more likely we'd be forever a Championship team, with the odd upset in playoffs/scare of relegation to League 1, I want nothing more than to just stay in the Premier League.

As for the love Bielsa gets, it's all based on his footballing impact, not accolades and trophies. He has a clear style of play, and he implements it at every club he goes to, win, lose or spanking (As we saw on Sunday). I think a lot of that admiration from people for him gets mixed for expecting him to be making Leeds a team challenging the top 6 (Or so it feels). People aren't followers of him or lovers of him because he wins trophies and tactically outclasses managers left right and centre, but for the exciting and clear style no matter the opponent, and how he is football mad in every way. He's an intriguing manager, which a strange personality and a pure passion for football as a game. Manchester United's starting 11 cost around £400m, and Leeds's cost around £70m. You'd never expect to win that game with any manager, so it's no surprise we lost. I wouldn't choose to lose heavy but it will happen with how we play, Bielsa's coaching and play style doesn't work miracles to overturn teams with starting lineups over 5x the price of ours (although some would argue our promotion seemed like a miracle for the majority of Leeds fans). But it does allow us to see our team actually compete with these teams and look like we can score just as easily as anyone, despite the clear weakness in our squad. That is what I admire.

&amp;#x200B;

Our performances in the league this season haven't been much different to teams in previous years who've stayed up, so I'm understandably happy with how we've played, even with some of the losses we've taken. We're doing well in relation to our avoid relegation target, and that is what I find important. But there's plenty of football to play, and many points to be won/lost, so I'm not naive to the possibility of relegation, anything can happen, but as things stand we're on track.

For me personally, I use watching Leeds now more than ever as an escape from the real world, from the upset of being in a tier 4 area over Christmas, and stresses of working in a critical worker sector right through all the lockdowns. This year has been hard for everyone, each of us with our own struggles and battles, but I'm glad football can continue, and I'm even happier knowing I can watch us play like we do. I don't think we're 'better' than any team because of it, morally or tactically. I just enjoy the viewing pleasure of how the players have bought into the exciting playstyle, and I'll make the most of it even if it results in relegation. I am and always be a Leeds fan, and regardless of the outcome of the season, I'll always appreciate that Bielsa has sparked my interest in Leeds to its maximum I've experienced (As a 20yr old fan whose only ever remembered/experienced doom and gloom), and given us hope that we can get back to being a 'big' team some day, even if that is many many years down the line.

This is a club that has the second-highest payroll in the league. It's phenomenally pathetic that they're not only out of the top half of the league but this close to suffering relegation.

PremierLeague,"Glad the concussion sub rule is coming in, fine with staying at 3 subs, but it got me thinking about other things that could be changed.

I’d like to see diving be penalised retroactively. I know in the NBA the referees review every decision (or non-decision) after the game, so if the same is done with football matches it should be pretty easy to identify dives (successful or otherwise). I think if you start handing out 1-match suspensions, players will be much less likely to dive.

I’d also like to see the 6-second rule actually be applied. This is in part to quell time wasting late on, but also just to speed up the play. Keepers take 10-15 seconds almost every time, more when they’re winning late on and go to ground after making a straightforward catch...I’d kinda like to see the how actually adhering to the rule affects play.

Finally, another one that’s already a rule but not implemented, I’d like to see bookings (and thus stopping players from doing it) when they stop a quick fee kick or throw. Like players commit a foul then grab the ball, or they just stand in front of the ball and stuff. I dunno, I’d like to see the game run more smoothly.

PremierLeague,"In my honest opinion I think it's such a close call, it really should benefit the attacker therefor onside. The check was very quick, they saw it was close and let it go, brilliant in that sense. But, this has not been done before and it's clearly inconsistent with the nanometer-checks we've seen earlier where checking the offside takes well over 3 minutes.

I honestly hope they continue to check like they did with this one. But if they now go back to zooming, drawing and checking toe nails for offside like before, it will show just another sign of inconsistent VAR  usage.

Would love to hear your opinions on this.

Should goals like this stand even if it was 100% proven to be just slightly off?

PremierLeague,"I was watching back Aston Villa's highlights against Wolves.

At 5:25 in this video, John McGinn is fouled and a penalty awarded: [https://twitter.com/AVFCOfficial/status/1338547301153787906](https://twitter.com/AVFCOfficial/status/1338547301153787906)

In the video, you can clearly hear the sound of players colliding. Even as a Villa fan I thought there wasn't much contact at the time. I can completely imagine the ref using his ears as well as his eyes to make the decision. In this instance, it wasn't overturned.

However, there have been other penalty decisions overturned. Since lockdown, teams have mostly been playing in empty stadiums, where you can hear more of the action.

I wonder if referees are using their ears more to make decisions. Then, when reviewing the slowed-down footage (either at Stockley Park or pitchside), they no longer use that audio. From different angles, contact between two players can look better or worse.

My theory is that in some cases, referees see what looks like contact, and their ears confirm it for them. However, on review, and without audio, that's overturned.

If that is the case (and someone with access to stats could check it), then a lo-fi option would be to keep the audio during reviews (if they don't already). Sports like cricket use snick-o-meters to determine how much contact was made between bat and ball.

As crowds return the pitchside mics may pick up less, but keeping the audio could be a useful signal to officials trying to decide whether, and how much contact was made, especially when it's unclear from different camera angles.",t2_cccks,Does lack of audio during reviews impact VAR decisions?,t3_kd3w30,Hitz365,0,"Does lack of audio during reviews impact VAR decisions?

PremierLeague,"The term sleepwalking towards disaster is well and truly applicable too Arsenal, from the days of consistently finishing 4th and gloating about it too now being an outright shambles, every step Arsenal have taken as a club has led them to this moment. From transfer strategy too management, everything is wrong structurally, and frankly with or without Mikel Arteta I think results wouldn’t be different. 

This is a problem that I believe could last up to a decade or beyond. I saw it with Liverpool (who probably started from a worse position in terms of squad and management before arriving too the brendan Rodgers and now loool era’s) and we can see it now with United where issues have remained permanently since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson. 

The worst part is the Arsenal fans. Who have now reared there true ugly heads (IMO). They are completely spineless, this is just based on the differing reactions from Liverpool and United fans when there clubs had/have fallen into turmoil.

These run of results should act as a humbling, yes Arsenal are a “big club”, but I see no acceptance of the current situation. When Emery was in it was about getting rid of him to find a style and give an opportunity to the younger players, that was the Arteta plan.

PremierLeague,"Last season they were being tipped as outsiders for UCL at one point. Now they'll need a miracle to escape relegation. 11 games so far this season, only a singular point picked up. What has gone wrong?

An interesting point to start on is Sheffield's wage bill: Only Leeds United come close in how little is spent on player wages. They're currently around the $20m USD mark, upgrading $4-5m since last season. For reference, Mesut Özil's salary is about the same as the entire Sheffield United team. Phil Jagielka is their best paid player.

Tactically, Sheffield play a 5-at-the-back, with a formidable center 3 being key to their good results last season. However, this time around, injuries have hit hard. Jack O'Connell's statistics show how well Sheffield perform with and without him: Sheffield win 475% more games with him, get 3 times more points per game, and concede half the amount of goals. Attempts to move around players to fix this haven't worked: they lack physicality, awareness, and pure quality. It's easy to see just how hard this has affected Sheffield as a whole.

Up front as well, Lys Mousset's lack of performances has left Sheffield stranded. And no offense to everybody in Sheffield's attack, but they need to improve heavily if they want to survive this season. In winter, a striker needs to be signed who can finish goals. If Sheffield's defense can partially recover themselves, and the attack can be improved to get Sheffield playing at last season's level, perhaps they won't see themselves facing Championship teams next season",t2_3x3og8tw,What's gone wrong at Sheffield United this season?,t3_kag2yr,Versigot,16,"What's gone wrong at Sheffield United this season?

PremierLeague,"As a newer fan to the PL and recently paying more attention to all the clubs and how they are doing, What do you think contributed to teams quick starts (Everton, Aston Villa, etc.) and there now falling off back into maybe more ""normal positions"" in the table for them? And vice versa for teams who started off badly but have now picked up the pace (ManU and Man City) what have they done to improve? Lastly, what do you think is the biggest contributor to Arsenal performing so poorly?

I feel a managers duties are to put out the best side each and every performance while also maintaining so rest for players in big stretches. I also think they are there to motivate players and challenge them to grow in aspects of their game that need development. However, a manager can only do so much and as much as they want their to perform the best, they cant actually control how the team goes out and plays. I see a lot of Arsenal fans who want to blame Arteta for Arsenals performances and my question is just why do you think he's to blame? Is he not putting out the best lineup? Again, I feel its a bit harsh to throw all criticism at a manager because the players are the ones actually out their on the pitch and he cant control the fact that someone like Aubameyang hasn't scored a game time goal in however many matches its been.

PremierLeague,"As another year soon comes to a close we see yet another year without the first openly gay Premier League player. This is not a problem most of us think about on a daily basis, but we really should.

Can you imagine? It's 2020 and gay footballers are still having to hide their true identities. Almost every other major industry has openly gay celebrities and influencers. Why is football (and sport in general) lagging so much behind?

My first thoughts were along the lines of players being afraid of their teammates' reactions. That they'd be afraid they might not be wanted in the locker room anymore because they shower together and so forth. Then I learned that [a number of gay players have come out to their teammates but not to the outside world](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/10/26/20-footballers-have-told-me-theyre-gay-says-top-football-boss/). Naturally, that is not to say that it doesn't play a role. The fear comes from a number of different factors and it differs between players. One huge factor is undoubtedly the reactions of us, the fans.

The problem of coming out was emphasized by an unnamed gay player of the Premier League [in an open letter](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/read-gay-premier-league-stars-22338520) earlier this year where he says: ""Day-to-day, it can be an absolute nightmare. And it is affecting my mental health more and more. I feel trapped and my fear is that disclosing the truth about what I am will only make things worse"". Furthermore, he states that ""I just don’t think football is ready yet for a player to come out"". I recommend you read the full letter, and to the player behind it, whoever you are, thank you for speaking out.

I think it is time that we as fans show the stars we all know and love that their sexuality does not affect our opinion of them. We need to make them feel welcome. We need to show them that football is ready for players to be themselves.

Will every single fan be supportive? Unfortunately, no. However, I firmly believe that a large majority of fans will be supportive and drown out the voices of the few.

Understandably, it is very hard to be the first player to come out of the closet. However, as we have seen in the past, these things become easier for each person following the last. Hopefully, we will see the first openly gay Premier League player soon. And the second. And the third. Until suddenly we will be shaking our heads that this was ever a problem in the first place.

To all the gay footballers in the Premier League (or elsewhere), if you ever read this, I want to say the following:

&gt;I support you and welcome your sexuality. I don't want you to live your life hiding who you are. I don't want you to have to live your golden years in mental agony. I want you to feel safe, loved, and supported as the person you truly are, because you deserve it. I understand that you might not feel ready to come out and I respect that, but if you are, know that I am ready for you.

If football is ever going to be ready, we need to show both our current and future gay stars that we care. Many of our favorite activities might be closed due to the pandemic, but we can show our beloved players that football is **open** for gays. #FootballIsOpenForGays

PremierLeague,"Watching the post match analysis of the Spurs-Arsenal game yesterday I couldn’t believe what I was hearing from Redknapp,Scott and Souness about Mourinho’s way of playing. They all said it’s “hard to watch” and that a lot of spurs players won’t like playing this way.

1. Surely the best way to play is the way that wins you games instead of trying to play into the opponents’ hands.

2. Why do they feel like they know better than the best manager of the last 15 years

3. Spurs players haven’t won a trophy and if a man comes in that has won everything in his career and tells you that you can win by doing it this way, surely you won’t have a problem with following his instructions.

1. Surely the best way to play is the way that wins you games instead of trying to play into the opponents’ hands.

2. Why do they feel like they know better than the best manager of the last 15 years

PremierLeague,"What happened to that club? I'm a Chelsea fan, so there's obviously a part of me that enjoys their misery. That said, I'm pretty shocked at how the fortunes have reversed. 

I remember 5 years ago, Chelsea was a midtable club that was in danger of being relegated for a part of the season while Arsenal was playing attacking football with Alexis Sanchez, Ozil, and Giroud leading the charge. They also were doing good business by developing the young talent and then buying from the outside at great prices to fill in the gaps/keep the squad competitive. I think they also had managed all or most of their stadium debt, so it seemed like the future was bright. They had the combination of good youth players, world class talent (Sanchez/Ozil at that time), and a self-sustaining model.

Now, look at them. They've spent almost as much as Chelsea, but have made horrible transfer purchases (Pepe), haven't gotten any results from their stars after handing them fat contracts (Ozil and Aubameyang thus far), and don't seem to be producing any Jack Wilshere or Theo Walcott type of talents from their academy anymore.

What led to quick and sudden decline? After missing champions league once, it seems they completely fell off, despite a supposedly self-sustaining model.

It's still early, but I think it's safe to say that Derby's 2007-08 record-breaking season of suck may be in a little bit of jeopardy if Sheffield United keeps nosediving.

PremierLeague,"Hi Everyone,

In the Arsenal vs Wolves match last week, Luiz came charging in for a header and collided with Jimenez in the box as he cleared the ball from a corner. I have heard a few people claiming Luiz came in recklessly however I think I agree with the majority here saying it’s a 50:50 ball with both players trying to help their team. Both players were grounded, with Luiz having a significant gash on the head which causes frequent bleeding during the match, and Jimenez actually being knocked unconscious as a result of the collision. It was reported Jimenez was out of it for around 10 minutes before regaining consciousness.

**Transcript:**

When you see 2 players collide like this, very similarly to the Bailly Maguire incident for United last year in the Fa Cup semi-final vs Chelsea, the 1st thing that comes to mind is potential concussions. The Fa and Premier League have been called out by pundits multiple times over the last few years particularly around this subject saying players do not have enough protection from these injuries and teams should be allowed to have temporary concussion substitutes. From a health standpoint I really like this recommendation because it removes the pressure on a manager to keep a player on in fear of using up an unnecessary sub and gives the injured player the most ample chance to recover and be assessed in that short amount of time.

Recently in the last few years the Fa introduced a concussion protocol for teams to follow depending on the league they are in. Regardless of who you play for, if a player (in this case Luiz and Jimenez) suffers a head injury the 1st thing you need to do as the healthcare professional is DR ABC (Danger, Response, Airways, Breathing and Cardiovascular) and assess for evidence of a concussion. A concussion is a term thrown around a lot in the media, but what does it actually mean in a medical context. A concussion ‘medically’ refers to a mild traumatic brain injury often caused by a bump or significant knock to the head which causes the brain to hit the inside of the skull. This can also occur when a person experiences whiplash.

When you have a player that has been involved in a head collision or injury, at first we are going to assess them and find out if they are showing any symptoms of concussion like dizziness &amp; headache. However in addition to asking them if they are experiencing any of these, something is to consider is players may not be telling the truth because they want to play particularly in situations where they are in the last year of their contract or fighting for a spot in the 1st team. So to control for this, we would ask a few questions testing for memory disturbance such as

1. What venue are you at today?
2. What half is it now?
3. Who scored last in the game?
4. Did you team win the last game?

Any incorrectly answered question may indicate that potentially a player is suffering from concussion however bear in mind someone with a brain injury may still be able to answer these correctly. In that very short time, the clinician has to make a decision whether they think a player has suffered a concussion or brain injury, which can be an extreme burden if a team is chasing a game and the star gets injured or big games are coming up. However, as the clinician you must isolate yourself from the surroundings and decide what is best for the player and only the player. If any potential signs of concussion arise, there is only 1 option. Take them to hospital for full and detailed health checks looking for possibility of brain injuries. Personally I have only been involved in 2 concussion checks live in a football match and both instances the player was ok and allowed to continue.

With David Luiz we can assume there were no signs of a concussion as he was able to play on by the Arsenal Medical team, however the big contention was surrounding why he was allowed to continue if blood was dripping down and if he was just not showing signs of injury. This is where the debate comes in, as the current rules say players who pass the concussion protocol test can continue to play and gashes as long as they can be controlled are minor occurrences as we have seen in Premier League history with many players wearing bandages around their heads during matches.

For regular concussion protocol players at the highest level of football with access to the best immediate treatment are scheduled to return after 1 week (6 days to be precise) and 12 days if 17-19. In grassroots football, this extends to 2-3 weeks depending on symptoms and if players are assessed as fit to return by healthcare staff at the respective clubs.

With Jimenez’s injury, things get more difficult because it has been reported he suffered a skull fracture as a result of the collision with Luiz. 2 Players I know off have suffered these injuries in the past, Petr Cech most famously who was able to return to play after a period out and become a Chelsea legend. Secondly. Ryan Mason who’s career was unfortunately ended as a result of the injury. From a medical standpoint, I am not too worried about the actual fracture as breaks in bones can always be fixed, reattached or connected using a metal plate (see full video for image of fixed skull). The more concerning matter at hand is the traumatic brain injury experienced however it will be interesting to see if Jimenez’s heading ability is affected by the injury or if his skull is more susceptible if something similar happens again.

“A skull fracture is one thing, the other more serious issues tend to be what’s going on with the underlying tissues,” says Dr Michael Grey, of the University of East Anglia. “Recovery wise, the fracture itself is less of an issue. The bones will repair themselves. They’ll start to fuse within two to three weeks, and it will be more or less solid again in six weeks.”

Yes the bones have to heal, but the real challenge I feel will be the making sure there are no neurological defects that may arise in the short term or potentially manifest itself later on in the future. **So, when will Jimenez return, based on all the information not a for a while is the best answer**. Even though its vague if we look at what Dr Grey said the skull alone with take around 6 weeks, but the time out is truly dependent on neurological symptoms. **If Jimenez shows any signs of degeneration neurologically this could end up very sadly for him with a potential career end but let’s all hope that doesn’t happen and he is able to return safe and healthy when the time is right**.

PremierLeague,"**Yes I am a Chelsea fan but I truly believe the points I make are unbiased facts.** 

So I just think that Lampard is doing really well with Chelsea, has shown signs of being a great tactician, adaptable to situations, not just a one trick pony and can win things with Chelsea.   
Since he has come in I have heard comparisons to him and Arteta saying ""Arteta worked under Pep he will show up Frank"" and ""Frank took Derby from 6th to 6th and took Chelsea from 3rd to 4th""  


I don't think people understand that to take a team into a Championship play off final in your FIRST EVER year as a manager is not a bad achievement. Also taking charge of a Chelsea side having gotten a transfer ban, brought in tonnes of youth players, lost their best player (Hazard) while other teams signed and improved.   


I also think that although last season they dropped lots of points to games they should have won due to individual errors, they performed great, have a really attractive style, have a go at teams. We played Liverpool 4 times last year, and in all of them games we were arguably the better team (maybe not in the 5-3) and would have won had we been more clinical.   


This season since Mendy and Silva have been regularly starting we have conceded like 4 goals in all comps, only lost to Liverpool (with 10 men for the second half, kepa giving away a goal and missing a penalty) and we have dropped points to WBA (due to alonso) and Southampton (due to kepa).

(Yes I know it's now GW11, just going to ignore that so Burnley don't appear ahead of Fulham)

Hopefully, as the season goes on, I'll be able to:

* Show all 20 teams in one table (it's just too close at the moment to fit all the teams in one table and make it look neat; hard enough now - see GW2 on the Big 6 graph)
* Make it look nicer, like the stuff on r/dataisbeautiful
* Have the little icons at the start and end so it's easier to follow how your club progresses
* Publish one of these about every 2-3 months or 10 gameweeks

The little diamonds represent one game in hand.

PremierLeague,"Hey all, another dumb American trying to get advice on what team to support here!

Some background, I am a huge sports fan and sports card collector that is trying to expand my watching and collecting horizons. I have typically only paid attention to baseball and American Football, but I recently have found myself wanting to watch and collect other sports as well. I have always loved baseball the most since I have a team I am dedicated to (go Yankees!), so I was wanting to get that same experience as I begin to watch Premier League matches.

After doing some browsing the common consensus seems to be to watch some matches and see who stands out to me, but for some reason that seems a bit impersonal to me. I am a Yankees fan because my family used to live in New York for generations, and I want that more personal connection to the team I support. This brought me to the idea of using Ancestry to figure out where my English ancestors were from. After a bit of digging I discovered that my 9th great-grandfather was born in Manchester before coming to the colonies in the early 1700's.

That helped me decide that I wanted to support a team from Manchester, but I know absolutely nothing about the differences between Manchester City and Manchester United. I was hoping to get a bit of help breaking down the clubs, their history, their fans, etc. between those two clubs so I can make a bit of a more informed decision before I start watching the matches more regularly. I have read a few things about each club, but since I don't have much background on the history of the league I was hoping to get more info on how the the clubs are perceived by those of you here. If any of you are fans of American Football or baseball as well and can make comparisons to teams from those sports as well that would be very helpful.

PremierLeague,"Thought this interview with Thomas Gronnemark was really interesting. He's a freelance throw-in coach (seemingly the only one in the world) who currently works with Liverpool and a number of other European clubs.

It's not an area of the game that I've ever put too much thought into - aside from admiring the odd long-throw taker and getting frustrated when I see no movement.

He talks about being met with a lot of scepticism over the course of his career, what do you all think about this level of specialisation?

The stats that he cites in terms of his impact at Liverpool are pretty impressive.

Do you know of any other Premier League clubs doing something similar? Or equally specialised coaches?

PremierLeague,"I am an Arsenal fan and I posted the below in the Arsenal community and got a mixed review, I would love to know what is the general consensus and if in your comments you could state the team you support, for reference.... 

  
For me personally, league-wide, VAR has to stay but has to be used in the correct way, think back to before VAR and how many goals were disallowed for offside when the player was onside, or how many goals were given even though the linesmen got it wrong and they were, in fact, offside or even fouls that when you watch the replay should be an absolute stonewall red card and sometimes aren't even given a yellow for.

Imagine the Auba goal against man utd last year when he was clearly about a yard onside and the linesman got it wrong, went to VAR, and got given.... but this season the officiating quality has just slowly declined and declined, no other league has these issues and officials from other countries constantly get selected over British referees for champions league finals and European and world cup goams, why? because the referees here stink, there needs to be a substantial investment into the training of referees in this country.

  
It's not even just about the offsides and drawing lines incorrectly and taking 3 minutes to come to a decision, there should be more reviews on shirt pulling the in the box for a corner as I'm seeing it weekly now across different games that defenders are pulling the back of the attacker's shirts and there's never a penalty for this...?

Beside the obvious need to re-visit the rules, should VAR be used with a challenge system like in tennis where a team get 2 or 3 challenges per match, if you get it wrong you lose a challenge? Can this be used for penalties at least if not offsides as players can’t really judge offsides?

PremierLeague,"I may be an upset Villa fan, but I have channeled my frustration into this post and would like to make a point.

When VAR officials do their thing, they choose a still-frame of the moment when they deem the ball was passed. Analysis of that still frame is only appropriate when distances are scrutinised to the same precision, to which that still frame was chosen on.

**Some calculations:**

\- The impact or contact time between the passer's foot and the ball is ""approximately 0.01 s"" \[1\] and more precisely, around 7.5 ms \[2\].

\- A player making a run will most likely be sprinting at close to his peak velocity, which is approximately 9.2 m/s for a high-level, professional striker \[3\]. The highest measured sprint speed of a footballer was 10.6 m/s \[4\].

\- Thus, while the passer makes contact with the ball, the forward moves a distance of 0.069 m or around 7 cm (using values of 7.5 ms and 9.2 m/s for contact time and sprint speed respectively).

I certainly feel that sometimes, VAR officials aim to judge offside to distances equal to or smaller than 7 cm... Ollie Watkins' offside tonight was by far not the closest. This would be measuring offside to a precision greater than that of our measurement, the still frame.

**Some other points I want to make:**

\- An additional variable could be the last defender moving in the opposite direction at the same time, meaning the margin may well change by 2 \* 7 = 14 cm while the ball is being passed.

\- The time precision in selecting the still frame may well slightly exceed the ball impact time, as there is probably a slightly longer apparent impact time when not analysed close-up in slow motion.

\- At distances of a few centimetres, many other miniscule factors could come into play, such as the length of shirtsleeves...

TL;DR the point I want to make is that offside is being judged to a physically ridiculous and impossible precision. I am surprised (or not really...) the PL/FA/FIFA didn't pay somebody to do these calculations for them.

**Edit, to include: What should be done, how do we move forward**:

For consistency, I understand little can probably be changed this season. A simple solution for offside would be to use thicker lines and judge it to be ""on-side"" if the lines touch. 

I'm fundamentally pro-VAR, but I think it needs a complete revamp, or ""project restart"" next season. Scrap everything we have and start from scratch. Use case studies from the past seasons and other leagues to reimplement what worked and find solutions for what didn't work. Pool the knowledge and opinions of former players, referees and fan associations to rebuild a better VAR.

PremierLeague,"I'm a West Ham fan and consider Tottenham, Chelsea and Millwall my team's main rivals. I've generally had a positive opinion of Arsenal and it's fans because: a) some of my extended family support them, b) the good football they played at the beginning of the millennium and c) Ian Wright was one of my earliest idols (that'll date me). I'm telling you this to give you a perspective of where this opinion is coming from.

I've noticed a steady decline of Arsenal since their peak when they had Henry, Bergkamp, Pires, Ljungberg, Campbell et al. (I mean everyone has) because:

1. **Wenger inherited an incredible back 5.** Wenger inherited a back 5 of Seaman, Dixon, Winterburn, Adams and Keown (with Bould able to interchange). All of them played for England (albeit Winterburn and Bould only played a few games). Even as those players have left, Sol Campbell, Lauren and Ashley Cole all got to play with them, learn from them and get integrated into a stable defence. Over time, it became clear that Wenger struggled to recruit and develop defensive players. I believe Arsenal still have a soft spine due to this even today. As a separate point: I think Wenger really planned on Ramsey and Wilshere having run that Arsenal midfield for a decade, which they may have if it hadn't have been for significant injuries at key points in their development.
2. **There's been a lack of investment into the club since Kroenke joined the club.** I've looked at the money spent before and after Kroenke buying the club and there definitely was a downturn in spending. Don't get me wrong, much of this previous spending was poorly done, but the change of ownership seems to be the catalyst. Some might say that the change of stadium was a reason for this, but nothing has changed even after that period.
3. **Scouting has been very questionable and with no real plan.** There have been some good players signed in recent years: Martinelli, Tierney, etc. There's also been a lot of horrendous signings: Mustafi (*£35m),* Perez (£17m), Kolasinac (£0m), Mavrpanos (£1.8m),  Mkhitaryan (swap deal), Lichtsteiner (£0m), Papastathopoulos (£14.4m), Torreira (£27m), Guendouzi (£8m) since 2016. Many of these players didn't seem to fit into the Arsenal team from day 1 of being signed. To add to that, Cedric Soares, David Luis and Willian are all clients of Kia Joorabchian. Soares played 5 times (mostly off the bench) in the season he was brought in on loan, despite a need for backup in the fullback positions. He wasn't Southampton's first choice the last few seasons towards the end of his time there, and were trying to shop him around.  Somehow, he was given a 4 year deal. David Luiz and Willian have been given lucrative deals despite their age. Willian was given a £200K 3 year contract having turned 32. David Luiz had his contract renewed having turned 33 and despite countless poor performances last season. That seems dodgy to me. Key scouts leaving due to Covid cutbacks hasn't helped.
4. **There was a huge power power vacuum when Wenger left.** It's well documented that Wenger did EVERYTHING towards the end of his time with Arsenal (recruitment, coaching, director of football etc). I think him leaving has left a giant power vacuum and changed the politics within the company. Sven Mislintat and Raul Sanllehi leaving abruptly is a sign of that. It definitely wasn't helped by Ivan Gazidis, who seemed to do the bidding of Kroenke.

These points are big picture takes that I have. I think looking in the short - term, I believe that Mikel Arteta should be given more time. If you hire a manager with zero experience in a league with Jurgen Klopp, Pep Guardiola, Jose Mourinho, Brendan Rodgers and Carlo Ancelotti, it has to be because you believe he has the right philosophy and traits to be successful. He's needed to learn on the job during a condenced and unusual season. I think he needs at least one full season and to see if he progress is being made and in fact, I would give him until the end of NEXT season.

Without Auba's goals, Arsenal would've been in a similar position to where they are now at any time in the last few seasons. Now that they've dried up (and to be clear, I'm not having a go at Auba for that - he's been amazing for 2.5 seasons and I haven't seen anyone step up to support him during his poor form), it's exposed what many Arsenal fans have told me previous that they're a very poor team without his goals.

Just to be clear, I don't know whether Arteta is the real deal yet. I've seen some good signs, but I he's not been consistent. I think getting rid of him so quickly won't serve Arsenal and only throw more instability in addition to the above issues.",t2_77u0nmmt,Arsenal from a (relatively) neutral point of view,t3_k3ud4k,PatientHair4031,4,"Arsenal from a (relatively) neutral point of view I'm a West Ham fan and consider Tottenham, Chelsea and Millwall my team's main rivals.

Embiid Dominates the Decimated Heat 

* Final Score: PHI 137 - 134 MIA (OT)
* Joel Embiid drops 45/16/4 with 5 steals and a block, shooting 16-23 (69%) from the field. What a monstrous performance from Embiid.
* Danny Green had 29/10/6 with 2 steals, shooting 10-25 (40%) from the field and 9-21 (43%) from three, which was a new career high. Great redemption game for Green after he went 0-9 from the field in the previous game. 
* Tyrese Maxey continues to look good out there finishing with 16/3/8 on 7-18 (39%) shooting. 
* Tyler Herro dropped a regular season career high with 34/7/4 on 12-26 (46%) FG, and 3-9 (33%) 3P. 
* Duncan Robinson splashed 6 threes to drop 26/2/1 on 8-18 (44%), and 6-14 (43%) 3P.
* Precious Achiuwa also had a nice game, finishing with 17/13/3 on 7-10 (70%) shooting from the field.

KD Does KD Things in Win Over Denver

* Final Score: BKN 122-116 DEN
* Kevin Durant looked like the KD of old last night with 34/9/13 on 12-18 (66%) FG, and 4-7 (57%) 3P, including a mean step back three dagger.
* Caris LeVert had himself a nice little game dropping 20/5/6 on 8-15 (53%) shooting from the field, and 2-5 (40%) from behind the arc.
* Nikola Jokic nearly collected another triple-double with 23/8/11 on 8-17 (47%) FG, and 1-4 (25%) 3P.
* Will Barton hit 6 threes, and finished with 22/2/1 on 8-14 (57%) FG, and 6-8 (75%) 3P.

Jazz Win Big over the Crippled Cavs

* Final Score: UTA 117-87 CLE
* Donovan Mitchell dropped 27/3/4 on 9-15 shooting (5-7 3P).
* Bojan Bogdanovic had a nice game with 20/2/3 on 6-10 shooting (4-6 3P).
* Cedi Osman led the Cavs in scoring with 17 points, and grabbed 4 boards with 6 assists on 7-15 shooting.

Lakers Dismantle Rockets Again

* Final Score: LAL 117-100 HOU
* LeBron finished with 26/8/5 on 10-20 shooting (4-9 3P).
* AD dropped 19 points and snagged 10 boards on a super efficient 7-8 shooting from the field (1-1 3P).
* Harden had another subpar performance finishing with just 16/7/6 on 5-16 shooting (1-6 3P). James would go onto publicly say after the game that the situation in Houston “can’t be fixed.”
* Christian Wood continues to look like a nice pick up for the Rockets, dropping 18/8/1 on 8-18 shooting (2-5 3P).

Spurs Get the Dub Over the Thunder

* Final Score: SAS 112-102 OKC
* Lonnie Walker had a great game, collecting 24/3/2 on 7-15 shooting (3-7 3P).
* Keldon Johnson continues to expand on his leap, finishing with 18/7/1 on 6-11 shooting.
* SGA ended up with 20/9/2 on 7-10 shooting. He definitely needs to look for his shot more, 10 FGA is far too little.

Pacers Beat the Rolling Warriors

* Final Score: IND 104-95 GSW
* Myles Turner had a terrific game, finishing with 22 points, 12 boards, 2 steals, and FIVE blocks on 7-11 shooting (3-5 3P).
* Sabonis also had a very nice game with 18/14/6 on 7-15 shooting.
* Malcolm Brogdon appears to have cooled off a little bit, only getting 13 points, 2 rebounds, and 8 assists on an ugly 5-18 from the field (2-6 3P).
* Shoutout to Aaron Holiday who finished with 16/2/12 on 6-16 shooting (2-5 3P).
* Steph only dropped 20 points, with 4 rebounds, and 3 assists on 7-17 shooting (3-8 3P).

nba,"I love this simple play that the Charlotte Hornets run out of time outs:

https://reddit.com/link/kws4lu/video/w7m1i0ihi6b61/player

It's really just a normal high pick and roll. Devonte' Graham brings the ball up, Gordon Hayward fakes setting a screen and slips to the wing, then Miles Bridges comes to set another and rolls to the rim:

https://reddit.com/link/kws4lu/video/rmztwh6ii6b61/player

The New York Knick defenders trap Graham, and in their heads they believe they're fine doing so because the bottom defender (in this case, Immanuel Quickley) will help cover the roller in the paint.

Pause it at the 11:52 mark, and everything looks great.

But when the pass is thrown, Bridges finds himself wide open below the basket. So where did the help defender go?

Turns out Quickley had to chase Terry Rozier, who was going around a PJ Washington screen on the other side of the floor while the high PnR was occurring:

https://reddit.com/link/kws4lu/video/yx7qd4hli6b61/player

It also helps that PJ can shoot the 3 as well, which forces his defender (Mitchell Robinson) to step out even farther from the paint and removes him as a help option.

Simply excellent spacing and timing, and executed to perfection.

Here's another look at this play, this time run against the Philadelphia 76ers:

nba,"Wiggins was often criticized with a lack of desire to play defense and constantly making dumb mistakes. He's a player who was born with insane athletic ability . He's a 6'8 guard with a 7'0 wingspan, really good lateral speed and phenomenal jumping ability. One would imagine that it'd correlate to good defense but defense is an effort thing.

While not the best indicator of stats and often not the most accurate, his matchup stats are impressive as well.

Interesting thought here. My opinion obviously. I have been watching the NBA since the 90s. Grew up on bulls. I am from LA so I lucked out with Kobe years. Spurs Even the heat and Lebron entering the league. It seems for me every year it gets harder and harder to watch the league. The golden state warriors run was the last good thing to happen. My point here being in these modern times with players no longer tied to any team, city, coach anything beyond their next contract the league has been hurt overall.

nba,"  

It’s no secret that, when Vince Carter wanted out of Toronto, he TANKED his game. Now, he argues that his 12ppg game jump (7ppg per 36) in scoring was related to having point guard Jason Kidd get him better shots, that doesn’t seem to hold water since it only marker a 2ppg jump from the season before. Nor does it explain how his free throw percentage jumped up 12% in New Jersey that year, or his increase in rebounding. 

But that aside, the question we have before is “Has James Harden entered Vince-Carter tank mode?”

**The Case For**

Over the last five games, Harden has failed to secure even as much as 22 points, the first such streak he has seen in over five years (2015). 

Moreover, his percentages are through the floor! A paltry 25% from the arc (a 10% drop from last season) and an embarrassing 37% from the floor. 

He is also -29 on the floor during that time, but his team is only -13 over those game.

**The Case Against**

His rebounding hasn’t taken a hit, and he is passing the ball well (he among tops in the league). 

Moreover, his free-throw percentage is still where it should be. 

Also, his turnovers are down. A guy who wasn’t trying would certainly be expected to be more careless with the ball. 

**Raw Stats Don’t Tell the Whole Story**

Of course, raw stats don’t tell the whole story, but the eye test can be subjective. 

**The Answer?**

I don’t know. The scoring average and shooting suggest something is off, but it might just be a cold hand. His rebounding, free-throw shooting, and especially his passing seems to suggest it is just a slump.

nba,"Adam Silver since becoming the commissioner has been very popular, receiving almost unanimous praise from all. He desperately wants to be well-liked so he often turns a blind eye to issues if it means keeping a superstar happy. A perfect example is what Kyrie Irving is doing right now- absolute nonsense. Skipping games and practices to party, while other players (like what George Hill spoke out on last night) just want to be with their family and they're not allowed to.

 David Stern (RIP) and Roger Goddell (nfl) were not afraid to fine players when they pulled stunts like this. They may have ruffled the feathers of superstars from time to time, but the league was nip and tuck. Now, players like Kyrie, Harden, John Wall, Lou Williams, etc. are renown for clubbing/ partying/ conduct detrimental to team in a COVID era where there is a lot of hypocrisy from league execs. The common player is expected to travel from city to city, going nowhere but the hotel or arena and not allowed to see any guests including family? I'm fine with that rule for COVID protocols , but you have to be strict on superstars going around doing whatever they want.

Also, the new ""no-high-fives"" rule is so dumb and naive. Players play for 48 minutes touching the same ball and bumping bodies, exchanging sweat but the ""high five"" for a teammate is going to be the straw that breaks the camel's back? Silver also needs to expand team rosters to 15-20 as a buffer in case of an outbreak. Teams like the Celtics and 76ers are getting screwed and Silver is sitting on his hands. 

In general, ratings and overall popularity of the league I feel is down big time and Silver (who has undoubtedly done a lot of good as commish and certainly needs to be commended for saving last year's season in the Bubble) has to be held accountable at some point. I hope he figures out these COVID protocols and remains consistent with teams and players across the board. Silver has been good, but I believe Roger Goddell has been better across the board and its' showing with their COVID protocols and Goodell is almost universally hated and people love Silver and have hardly ever heard anyone criticize him.",t2_1hyjro62,Why isn't Adam Silver criticized more?,t3_kwhd96,wesskywalker,64,"Why isn't Adam Silver criticized more? Adam Silver since becoming the commissioner has been very popular, receiving almost unanimous praise from all. He desperately wants to be well-liked so he often turns a blind eye to issues if it means keeping a superstar happy. A perfect example is what Kyrie Irving is doing right now- absolute nonsense. Skipping games and practices to party, while other players (like what George Hill spoke out on last night) just want to be with their family and they're not allowed to.

 David Stern (RIP) and Roger Goddell (nfl) were not afraid to fine players when they pulled stunts like this. They may have ruffled the feathers of superstars from time to time, but the league was nip and tuck. Now, players like Kyrie, Harden, John Wall, Lou Williams, etc. are renown for clubbing/ partying/ conduct detrimental to team in a COVID era where there is a lot of hypocrisy from league execs.

nba,"With the way Lonzo is being used this year and the Pelicans not extending him, I think he's going to get traded this year. SVG is using Ingram as a point forward this year and they've moved him off ball as a spot up shooter and a secondary playmaker. I don't think the Pelicans see him as a long term part of their future especially with the way he's played so far. I think he needs a new team.

The first team that would be perfect for Lonzo is the Clippers. I think Lonzo is the perfect point guard to put next to Kawhi and PG. He's not ball dominant and he's the facilitator they've needed. To me it's the Clippers biggest problem. They don't have a point guard who could set up the offense. Everyone likes to put most of the blame on Trez and Doc for the collapse against Denver but their offense was really stagnant without a real point guard. The Clippers could trade Luke Kennard to the Pelicans as the main headliner for Lonzo. The Pelicans would want a young player in return for him and not someone like Lou Will or Pat Bev. If you think about it, Kennard would be a better fit in the role that the Pelicans are trying to use Lonzo in right now. From a basketball fit on both sides, the trade works out. I just don't know if the Clippers have enough assets to get Lonzo at this point.

The second team that would be really interesting is the Suns. I think the Suns really missed out on Haliburton. It would really interesting if you could recreate the 3 guard lineup OKC had last year that was one of the best lineups in the league last year. The Suns really don't have a point guard of the future after CP3. You could have Lonzo run the bench unit and close out games with CP3 &amp; Booker. With that lineup, you could also play at a really fast pace with 3 ball handlers. I think Phoenix has more to offer the Pelicans in terms of assets. They could trade Cam Johnson or Saric to the Pelicans. Saric would be nice next to Zion because he can open the paint for him. I don't know if the Phoenix fit is perfect but it's definitely an interesting experiment.

I think those teams would be really good destinations for Lonzo. What other teams do you think are good fits for him?",t2_rvcx3,Lonzo Ball trade destinations?,t3_kwiase,syarre,54,"Lonzo Ball trade destinations? With the way Lonzo is being used this year and the Pelicans not extending him, I think he's going to get traded this year. SVG is using Ingram as a point forward this year and they've moved him off ball as a spot up shooter and a secondary playmaker. I don't think the Pelicans see him as a long term part of their future especially with the way he's played so far. I think he needs a new team.

The first team that would be perfect for Lonzo is the Clippers. I think Lonzo is the perfect point guard to put next to Kawhi and PG. He's not ball dominant and he's the facilitator they've needed. To me it's the Clippers biggest problem. They don't have a point guard who could set up the offense.

I know this wont get much traction from non-Raptors fans but I think its disgusting how much hate he got and continues to get after 3.5 bad games to start the season. This isnt Patrick Beverley telling everyone ""The next 4 years are mine"". This is a 26th pick who worked his ass off in the gleague, became a great bench player, 2nd option on a championship team, an allnba caliber player, and then had a poor performance in the bubble because he couldnt practice during quarantine.

nba,"Views on Simmons tend to be split on this sub. One party goes completely out of their way to shit on his shooting. The other side credits his defense, playmaking and over all pace pushing  and considers him a top 15-20 player or so. Personally, I’m kind of in the middle. He’s truly one of the best defenders in the league because of his versatility. However, other  than defense, he  doesn’t bring much to the table. Ignoring his poor, nonexistent jump shooting, his overall scoring ability is poor. He’s not a “force” in the paint for being such a gifted athlete. He has no go to scoring moves. When we look at Giannis, we see a great inside scorer whom the defense knows wants to get to the rim every time. Still, he finds a way to utilize his footwork, patience, touch, and one-two step to score whenever he wants. Not saying Ben Simmons needs to be Giannis, but Simmons’ “ go to move” is to pummel into the defense and heave up an awkward runner. If he gets fouled, he can’t make his free throws. There’s so many instances where Simmons uses no ball handling or any sort of move and just tries to blow past you. Of course, that doesn’t work very often in the NBA. He needs to work on his basketball skills and not just his jumper. He’s also not some incredible playmaker. He passes literally any time a teammate is open. If you have the ball in your hands as much as he does, of course your going to get assists. He picks up silly fouls . He fouled on like three jumpers last night. He picks up so many charges blindly ramming into the defense on the break. Yeah, he’s a forward that handles the ball. That not an extremity these days. Some people tend to gawk at the fact that he’s tall and can take the ball down the floor, but when you can’t create your own shot whatsoever, that’s not an advantage. So personally, I think he’s slightly overrated. He’s not just a perimeter player that doesn’t shoot jumpers. He has very little interior skill as well. People tend to ignore that. I know this is going to fetch a lot of shit, but if you watch every game and analyze it as much as I do , you realize he’s a complete nonfactor on offense for the most part.",t2_4rt0mn91,Opinion on Ben Simmons?,t3_kwmjh8,Fair-Row-7014,56,"Opinion on Ben Simmons?

nba,"As I a Warriors fan, it's been frustrating to watch the box-and-one continue to disrupt the offense. So I started thinking of what could possibly work.

So the startling lineup right now is Curry-Oubre-Wiggins-Dray-Wiseman

Some stats for context:

Steph Curry: Career 43.3% career 3-point shooter

Kelly Oubre Jr: Career 32.2% career 3-point shooter, 35.2% last year. 17.2% so far this year but that'll obviously increase, he's had two games where he's gone 4-6 and 3-7, his slump will hopefully be over with.

Andrew Wiggins: Career 33.5% career 3-point shooter, 39.3 3p% this season. Shoots 40.5% in the corner for his career. Has had games of 5-8 and 4-9 so far.

Draymond Green: 7 assists per game since 2015-16.

Wiseman: 40% 3 point shooter but 55.6% free throw shooter

I don't know if Wiseman can be considered a ""good"" 3 point threat considering he's a 56% free throw shooter and free throw shooting tends to be a indicator of shooting ability but he does seem to have enough of a mid-range/3 point touch to at least have to be guarded at some level

So with Curry bringing the ball up, Wiseman could set a screen near half court while Curry is bring the ball up at full speed. This will cause the center to have to come on to Curry and whoever's guarding to him to be further back if he continues to chase Curry. This brings up more options. Steph could obviously just pull up for 3. Draymond can be in the free throw line area to receive a pass from Steph if the center isn't giving enough space. Wiggins should be in one corner, Wiseman straight away from the 3 point line, and if the center and Steph's defender commit to Curry, Wiseman would have a wide open 3 that he could take, take a step in for a midrange, or drive in for a dunk as he has length and is a great athlete

Now if Curry and Wiseman are both covered, Draymond can hit Wiggins, who can take the corner 3 or catch and drive as he is fast and athletic and may be able to score. I'm not sure if Oubre should be in the other corner for maximum spacing since Draymond can't space the floor, or if he should be in the dunker's spot for an alley or put back. But if Oubre's slump is over he could easily fit in both spots and from there the court is completely opened up. If a shot goes up Wiggins, Oubre, and Wiseman are all also athletic enough to come crashing in for a put back.

As for the closing lineup, it becomes more tricky since Kerr has to choose between Looney and Lee. If he goes with Lee, who's a 35.8% career 3 point shooter and 45.7 3p% shooter this season. Oubre might be able to take Wiseman's role as a screener since it seems like Oubre is a better shooter from the wing/top. I don't have stats to back me up on this conclusion but based on what I've seen in the preseason/this season he seems better there. Lee could then take Oubre's spot in the corner.

If Looney is out there, it becomes a little harder since he can't really space the floor but I guess he can set a hard screen for Steph and just roll to the rim. If Oubre becomes a dependable enough shooter to spread the floor, this should be able to completely negate the box and 1 and get rid of that defense and the Warriors can run their normal offense.

I obviously simplified it a lot and there's more moving parts, ie Curry running to the corner and getting Wiggins/Oubre screening for him.

nba,"Last year, I did a basic breakdown of the different looks the Warriors got using the same play 10 times in one quarter to beat the Rockets in Game 6 2018. Had a lot of fun just watching the same play as they ran the same the thing but scored in different ways. So, I thought I’d do another one for the Heat.

https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/g930mw/in_the_4q_of_game_6_warriors_vs_rockets_2019_the/

Spoelstra’s inbound plays are in my opinion, under appreciated. He’s won so many close games with it by using similar plays in different ways. Here is a breakdown of three different plays used in six different situations.

Disclaimer: this isn’t supposed to be a fully in-depth breakdown. My main aim for this is to help people who do not know too much about the x’s and o’s to have an idea of the though process when drawing up plays and even the inbounder. This allows them to have a better enjoyment of the game when they can recognise similar plays and their aim. Think like Tony Romo breaking down plays before they even happen. That and cause I am bored during the holidays and I just like basketball.

**Play 1**

[Lebron Inbound (play breaks down)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnyazvtC0_U&amp;ab_channel=NBA)

[Above play but Wade Alley oop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLRZFkj9alg&amp;ab_channel=NBAFullHighlights)

The first play is used in two different ways. Here, the two main targets for this are Wade (alley-oop) and Lebron (handoff to a PnR).
In the first clip, you can see the play working as Wade gets an alley-oop. Wade is the first option here as the game is tied and with 5 seconds left, Miami wanted a quick bucket.

The two main things to notice are:

* Mario Chalmers. Chalmers starting on the opposite side of the court acts as a decoy as he cuts all the way to the other corner through the baseline. His job is to draw his defender to the other side and clear space for Wade.

* Stagger Screen. Bosh and Battier sets a stagger screen for Wade to slow down Rubio and beat him to the basket.
In the second clip, we can see an example of this play breaking down, but the Heat managed to recover and tie the game. Although there were 21.1 seconds left, we could say that the play for Wade broke down as they couldn’t get the pass to him. However, being down by three, that is fine.

Let’s say the play was for Wade to be an alley-oop like above. The play breaks down as Wade does not have space in the paint for the alley-oop (notice Lebron also looking to pass). Notice how much lower Bosh and Battier set their screen? They are in the paint vs in the midrange like the first clip.

With Wade’s option gone, they then go to a handoff using Battier. Battier and Bosh then acts as a stagger for Lebron who tries to drive. Lebron had a nice drive if it wasn’t for David West playing help D (which left Battier open in the corner). (Also, notice Battier setting the screen for Chalmers). At this point, I’d consider is when the “play” ends.

**Play 2**

[Richardson winner](https://youtu.be/laSsfNmvxQc?t=66)

[Ellington winner](https://youtu.be/5pJ2PWZe9po?t=12)

The second play is my favourite. I believe the Heat ran this a lot in 2017-2018 but can only find two clips of the play. I will be using the Richardson clip to talk through the play.

Here, the play starts off with Richardson, then TJ, going off Ellington (we called this an X cut or X something in our team). This allows Tyler Johnson to be open in the top corner. Also, Richardson’s aim is to fake out the defender that he is cutting baseline (for this to work, one needs to go through that first screen hard to sell the fake). First option, TJ (unlikely as cross court pass).

The next step is Ellington curling off Olynyk’s screen to the corner which is another open look (note 2nd clip). Meanwhile, Olynyk now sets a screen for Richardson to go back to the top. This is an effective screen as his defender is both caught off guard by his cutback and does not see the screen as it is behind him (look at Mitchell who is completely lost under the hoop). Second option: Ellington, third option: Richardson open three.

Lastly, the play goes into a drive by Richardson. Here, you can see the Center steps up to defend Richardson due to Mitchell being hit by a screen. Instead of the three, this allows Richardson to easily beat him and get the layup. Another look is a pass to Olynyk (PnR) or a corner three by TJ if his defender plays help D tighter. 

Overall, I really love this play. You have so many different options for cutters, three and PnR depending on how much of the play you develop.
Comparing the Richardson possession to the Ellington one (link here again), the play breaks down as Richardson doesn’t sell the fake hard enough (defender is all over him and he gets double at the top) but most importantly, the Raptors switched on every defender allowing them to prevent the pass.

Dragic’s pass to Ellington is nice for the three but Ellington recognises they only need the two opts for the drive (which worked as Siakam overplays him). Also note that Olynyk is wide open due to his defender doubling Richardson).

**Play 3/4**

[Lebron layup winner vs Pacers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p3xWG3mkXE&amp;ab_channel=NBA)

[Wade Ties to OT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuKqIZrlBno&amp;ab_channel=NBAHighlights2)
 
The last play is quite a simple one. Here, the Heat aims to clear out the inside by drawing all their defenders to their shooters and take away help defence inside. Here is Lebron’s game winning layup vs the Pacers. Also, Wade uses this to tie the game vs Pacers. (Insert Paul George joke defending clutch shots here).

In the Lebron clip, you have Norris Cole, Allen and Bosh used as decoys for Lebron. Cole and Bosh cuts away from the inbound side to draw out their defenders away from the ball. Meanwhile, a reason Lebron gets so open is because Ray Allen is on the inbounding side corner. It would be dumb not to play tight on Allen as he is a great three-point shooter.
With everyone in the perimeter, this gives Lebron an easy open lane. You can tell it was never meant for the three as 1) he doesn’t square his feet when catching the ball and 2) he drives using his inside foot to put PG behind him after the first dribble.

In the Wade clip, the main difference is Wade is coming off a Bosh screen to receive the pass.

Fundamentally, its still the same concept but this time, Bosh draws out his defender by setting the screen high to make it seem like he is popping out for the three. This draws out his defender and gave him a clear lane until the help defence stepped up. 

In conclusion, inbound plays are cool as if you watch them close enough, you will notice the inbounder go through the progression and their patience as they go through different looks and fakes to find a play. Sometimes your first option works (ie Wade alley-oop) or sometimes you are forced to just throw it in and hope for the best (Ellington drive). But a bucket is a bucket.

Here is a basic breakdown of 3 different plays used in 6 different ways.,t3_kw1pjv,MySilverBurrito,22,"[Discussion] Spoelstra's inbound plays during crunch time are imo under appreciated. Here is a basic breakdown of 3 different plays used in 6 different ways. Last year, I did a basic breakdown of the different looks the Warriors got using the same play 10 times in one quarter to beat the Rockets in Game 6 2018. Had a lot of fun just watching the same play as they ran the same the thing but scored in different ways. So, I thought I’d do another one for the Heat.

https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/g930mw/in_the_4q_of_game_6_warriors_vs_rockets_2019_the/

Spoelstra’s inbound plays are in my opinion, under appreciated. He’s won so many close games with it by using similar plays in different ways. Here is a breakdown of three different plays used in six different situations.

Disclaimer: this isn’t supposed to be a fully in-depth breakdown. My main aim for this is to help people who do not know too much about the x’s and o’s to have an idea of the though process when drawing up plays and even the inbounder. This allows them to have a better enjoyment of the game when they can recognise similar plays and their aim. Think like Tony Romo breaking down plays before they even happen. That and cause I am bored during the holidays and I just like basketball.

**Play 1**

[Lebron Inbound (play breaks down)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnyazvtC0_U&amp;ab_channel=NBA)

[Above play but Wade Alley oop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLRZFkj9alg&amp;ab_channel=NBAFullHighlights)

The first play is used in two different ways. Here, the two main targets for this are Wade (alley-oop) and Lebron (handoff to a PnR).
In the first clip, you can see the play working as Wade gets an alley-oop. Wade is the first option here as the game is tied and with 5 seconds left, Miami wanted a quick bucket.

The two main things to notice are:

* Mario Chalmers. Chalmers starting on the opposite side of the court acts as a decoy as he cuts all the way to the other corner through the baseline. His job is to draw his defender to the other side and clear space for Wade.

* Stagger Screen. Bosh and Battier sets a stagger screen for Wade to slow down Rubio and beat him to the basket.
In the second clip, we can see an example of this play breaking down, but the Heat managed to recover and tie the game. Although there were 21.1 seconds left, we could say that the play for Wade broke down as they couldn’t get the pass to him. However, being down by three, that is fine.

Let’s say the play was for Wade to be an alley-oop like above. The play breaks down as Wade does not have space in the paint for the alley-oop (notice Lebron also looking to pass). Notice how much lower Bosh and Battier set their screen? They are in the paint vs in the midrange like the first clip.

With Wade’s option gone, they then go to a handoff using Battier. Battier and Bosh then acts as a stagger for Lebron who tries to drive. Lebron had a nice drive if it wasn’t for David West playing help D (which left Battier open in the corner). (Also, notice Battier setting the screen for Chalmers). At this point, I’d consider is when the “play” ends.

**Play 2**

[Richardson winner](https://youtu.be/laSsfNmvxQc?t=66)

[Ellington winner](https://youtu.be/5pJ2PWZe9po?t=12)

The second play is my favourite. I believe the Heat ran this a lot in 2017-2018 but can only find two clips of the play. I will be using the Richardson clip to talk through the play.

Here, the play starts off with Richardson, then TJ, going off Ellington (we called this an X cut or X something in our team). This allows Tyler Johnson to be open in the top corner. Also, Richardson’s aim is to fake out the defender that he is cutting baseline (for this to work, one needs to go through that first screen hard to sell the fake). First option, TJ (unlikely as cross court pass).

The next step is Ellington curling off Olynyk’s screen to the corner which is another open look (note 2nd clip). Meanwhile, Olynyk now sets a screen for Richardson to go back to the top. This is an effective screen as his defender is both caught off guard by his cutback and does not see the screen as it is behind him (look at Mitchell who is completely lost under the hoop). Second option: Ellington, third option: Richardson open three.

Lastly, the play goes into a drive by Richardson. Here, you can see the Center steps up to defend Richardson due to Mitchell being hit by a screen. Instead of the three, this allows Richardson to easily beat him and get the layup. Another look is a pass to Olynyk (PnR) or a corner three by TJ if his defender plays help D tighter.

Today it’s the 3rd best shooting guard of all time. Mr Wade had already won a finals and a FMVP at this point, but generally, this is considered the year he was at his peak. And much like he is on the all time shooting guard list, he also finished third in mvp voting. Although there isn’t much shame in getting beat by Kobe and Lebron.

nba,"Russell Westbrook is portrayed as an arrogant egotistical Selfish player on the court and a sulky, rude, and brazen personality by the media. This is far from the truth. Russ is one of the nicest guys in the NBA not just to his teammates but also to the general public. His foundation - the Russell Westbrook Why Not? Foundation was started by him to implement young people to never give up on their dream and  believe everything is possible. 

Here is some stuff he and his foundation has done

- handed out shoes and backpacks to 65 homeless children in Oklahoma City.

- partnered with the Advisory Board of Crystals to create t-shirts to profit LA’s Inner City Arts School.

-Launched a program that will provide digital job skills to at-risk young adults in the Corps and break down the digital divide by providing skill training for green tech job opportunities to 500 Corpsmembers in Los Angeles.

-Russell Westbrook hosted a Thanksgiving dinner along with his family, friends and Rockets teammate, James Harden, serving over 600 meals at Jesse Owens Park in Los Angeles.
He has done this since 2013

-hosted a party with JMA Energy Company for homeless children living at City Rescue Mission.

- and much much more.

https://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/russell-westbrook

What sticks out is that Russ doesn't just throw out money for charity, he's actively involved in every one of the events and takes a huge part it.

This was what he said about his teammates in his MVP speech

“Next, I want to thank my teammates. If y’all won’t mind, you guys would come up here, I’d appreciate that. Vic, Dre, Enes, Nick, Taj, my teammates. … Alright, alright, alright, y’all looking good. My guys, man. Obviously, all of the guys they’re not here tonight, but these are my brothers, man. These guys sacrificed so much for me throughout the year. It was obviously an amazing season for me, but without these guys, the rest of our guys that’s not here, none of this would be possible. This award is not for me, it’s for all of you guys, and I’m very, very thankful to have you guys in my corner.

Here's a video of him interacting with a young fan giving him a signed shoe for a pizza.

The hate on Russ is making me extremely sad, hopefully you guys have learned a lot today.",t2_90v3ihul,The truth about Russell Westbrook - the most misunderstood Superstar in NBA history.,t3_kvl1zp,MyLordJokic,294,"The truth about Russell Westbrook - the most misunderstood Superstar in NBA history. Russell Westbrook is portrayed as an arrogant egotistical Selfish player on the court and a sulky, rude, and brazen personality by the media. This is far from the truth. Russ is one of the nicest guys in the NBA not just to his teammates but also to the general public. His foundation - the Russell Westbrook Why Not? Foundation was started by him to implement young people to never give up on their dream and  believe everything is possible. 

Here is some stuff he and his foundation has done

- handed out shoes and backpacks to 65 homeless children in Oklahoma City.

- partnered with the Advisory Board of Crystals to create t-shirts to profit LA’s Inner City Arts School.

-Launched a program that will provide digital job skills to at-risk young adults in the Corps and break down the digital divide by providing skill training for green tech job opportunities to 500 Corpsmembers in Los Angeles.

-Russell Westbrook hosted a Thanksgiving dinner along with his family, friends and Rockets teammate, James Harden, serving over 600 meals at Jesse Owens Park in Los Angeles.
He has done this since 2013

-hosted a party with JMA Energy Company for homeless children living at City Rescue Mission.

- and much much more.

What sticks out is that Russ doesn't just throw out money for charity, he's actively involved in every one of the events and takes a huge part it.

This was what he said about his teammates in his MVP speech

“Next, I want to thank my teammates. If y’all won’t mind, you guys would come up here, I’d appreciate that. Vic, Dre, Enes, Nick, Taj, my teammates. … Alright, alright, alright, y’all looking good. My guys, man. Obviously, all of the guys they’re not here tonight, but these are my brothers, man. These guys sacrificed so much for me throughout the year. It was obviously an amazing season for me, but without these guys, the rest of our guys that’s not here, none of this would be possible. This award is not for me, it’s for all of you guys, and I’m very, very thankful to have you guys in my corner. You guys are my brothers for life, and I just thank you guys and love all you guys, so thank you"".

He's one of the best and loyal teammates of all time.

nba,"I believe this was first proposed by Kirk Goldsberry. But I have grown increasingly convinced that the NBA would really benefit in just eliminating the corner 3, by pushing back the line to create a uniform 3 pointer distance around the hoop. I think this would entirely eliminate the corner 3, because it would essentially push it out of bounds. You could theoretically widen the court, but that seems like a no go because of seats and revenue shit.

The game is becoming more and more homogenous, and having the line where it is now actively incentivizes having 2 players just standing still. Yeah, it may be slightly unfair to players who have built their entire game around that shot, but I think it would be much better in the long term. The style of play in the NBA is created largely based off the rules, and I think this would keep all the players from feeling like they have to shoot corner 3s to play

This would make off the dribble and above the break 3 point shooters much more valuable. As well as off the dribble creators. So players like Steph and Dame would be even more important and highlighted. And at the risk of sounding like an old man, it could bring back the lost art of the mid-range. Which is now just totally ignored on most good teams.

Anyway, at the very least I think they should implement a ""3 in the key"" type rule for the corner where you can't stand there for longer than 3 seconds.",t2_9g38c,Should the NBA extend the 3 point line in the corners?,t3_kwin70,rhino1623,15,"Should the NBA extend the 3 point line in the corners? I believe this was first proposed by Kirk Goldsberry. But I have grown increasingly convinced that the NBA would really benefit in just eliminating the corner 3, by pushing back the line to create a uniform 3 pointer distance around the hoop. I think this would entirely eliminate the corner 3, because it would essentially push it out of bounds. You could theoretically widen the court, but that seems like a no go because of seats and revenue shit.

The game is becoming more and more homogenous, and having the line where it is now actively incentivizes having 2 players just standing still. Yeah, it may be slightly unfair to players who have built their entire game around that shot, but I think it would be much better in the long term.

nba,"I remember last year this sub was a bit down on Drummond (around the time of the trade deadline) when Cleveland traded a 2nd and filler for Drummond. To many, the trade was confusing as people didn't understand why the Cavaliers would want him in the first place considering the state of their franchise. I'm not going to lie, I watched very few Pistons games and Cavs games last year, but the general consensus by other people was that Drummond was a bad defender and his steals and blocks were inflated due to him gambling too much. I even remember this sub heavily clowning him when he was upset about not making the all defensive team last year and when he said he made it a target to win DPOY last year.

Hey y'all back again here, also want to say again that to whoever sent me a DM yesterday on here, I swiped on the notification but the message disappeared, so I am not blowing you off and if you could send it again that would be appreciated. Thanks and hope you enjoy today's edition:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Kings and Pacers Battle it Out in Sacremento
   * Harrison Barnes and De'Aaron Fox lead the Kings as Barnes poured in a season high 30 points on 10/14 shooting to go along with 8 boards in 37 minutes. Fox had 21 points with 5 boards and  9 assists on 7/19 shooting and iced the game for the Kings with this ridiculous dunk([https://twitter.com/WorldWideWob/status/1348863181058408448?s=20](https://twitter.com/WorldWideWob/status/1348863181058408448?s=20))
   * Sabonis continued his strong start to the season with 28 points, 11 rebounds and 3 assists on 12/21 shooting marking his second straight outing with 28 points, while Brogdon also continues his great start as well with a 24/4/9 line on 9/18 shooting in 37 minutes.
   * The Defenders were active in this game. While struggling with his shot going 2/11 from three although scoring 21 points, Victor Oladipo recorded 6 steals and Myles Turner had 2 steals and 3 blocks in the losing effort as well. Richaun Holmes played awesome in the win for the Kings as well with a 16 point and 10 board double double on 6/11 shooting and had a career high 6 blocks. Holmes continues to be a pretty awesome 9 cat player

&amp;#x200B;

* Beal and Booker Duel in Washington
   * Beal and the Wizards got the win over Phoenix without Westbrook with a 34/8/9 line on 12/22 shooting. Beal continues to be an absolute stud and even more so without Westbrook in the lineup. Beal's past three outings have been 60, 41, and 34 points. It was nice to see this one finally translate to a win for the Wizards
   * Devin Booker broke through for a season high 33 points on 11/21 shooting in 32 minutes in the loss to Washington. Chris Paul also played solid with a 14 point and 11 assist double double. This is back to back games with double digit assists for Paul as he is starting to find his groove in Phoenix

&amp;#x200B;

* Trae Young and Hawks End Skid vs Depleted 76ers
   * Trae Young finally got back to the Trae we were seeing earlier this season with 26 points on 9/19 shooting and 3/7 from three to go with 3 boards and 8 assists. This was all in 25 minutes as the Hawks took a commanding lead in the 3rd and Trae sat the 4th. Pretty balanced effort bu the Hawks with every other starter reaching double points in the range of 10-15 points in the win for Atlanta.
   * Embiid was off to a very hot start in this game, but the 76ers couldn't keep up with Atlanta and he only played 22 minutes, but finished with a 24 point 11 rebound double-double on 8/17 shooting. He continues to play at an elite level this season and should certainly be seeing more than 22 minutes going forward

&amp;#x200B;

* Raptors Choke One Away to CJ and the Blazers
   * Yeah you read that title right, again it was not Dame and the Blazers, but it is CJ McCollum who continues to impress this season with a 30/6/5 line on 10/19 shooting and 5/11 from three in 38 minutes including a tough go ahead shot in the final seconds of the game. CJ is playing at an All-Star level this season with a career high 28 points per game, while Dame also had a solid showing for Portland with 23 points, 7 rebounds and 5 assists on 8/16 shooting in the win, although he racked up 8 turnovers
   * Pascal Siakam was awesome in the loss with his first career triple double on a 22/13/10 line in 36 minutes on 9/17 shooting. OG and Lowry also played solid for the Raptors with 18 a piece for the squad, but still they could not find a way to get the win and have fallen to 2-8 on the season. I do not think anyone in the world would have predicted 10 games into the season, the Raptors are tied with the Pistons for the worst record in the league

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Quick Hitters

* Giannis had a solid game with 22 points with 6 boards and 4 assists on 8/16 shooting with a steal and two blocks, while Middleton also was solid with 20/10/3 on 9/17 shooting as the Bucks took over to beat the Magic in the fourth.
* Bobby Portis put up another solid outing in the win with 20 points and 5 rebounds on 9/13 shooting in 24 minutes. He is a solid player to add as he does have lots of value when Giannis is out and it is encouraging to see him play well with Giannis in
* Nikola Vuceciv continues to play at a career best level in Orlando with a 28/13/5 line in the loss to the Bucks on 11/25 shooting. Vuc continues to be a stud for the Magic, while Aaron Gordo also stuffed the sheet a little bit with a 21/5/8 line on 8/14 shooting including a monster dunk over Giannis
* Buddy Hield dropped 18 points on 6/11 shooting all from beyond the arc while adding 4 boards and 3 assists as well in the win while drilling some clutch three pointers in the fourth
* Doug McDermott had an efficient 21 points on 8/10 shooting and 3/5 from three in 29 minutes. McDermott and Holiday seem to be the only two relevant bench players for the Pacers at this moment
* Davis Bertans saw 24 minutes off the bench for Washington and scored 18 points all on threes on 6/10 shooting and 6/9 from three. This was a nice bounce back game for Bertans after his 0/4 outing from three in his last showing
* Robin Lopez put up an 11 point, 11 rebound double-double starting in the place of Bryant. He might have some solid value this season with the loss of Bryant for Washington
* Gordon Hayward continues to just be really damn good in Charlotte. This might be the best Gordon Hayward we have seen yet honestly with a 34/3/3 line on 11/17 shooting, 10/10 from the line and 2/2 from three. There was a lot of criticism on his contract, but the he's starting to prove people wrong as the Hornets won their fourth in a row
* Julius Randle came back down to earth today with a 11/5/5 line on 2/9 shooting and four turnovers in the loss to Charlotte, while Kevin Knox actually played really well with 19 points on 7/17 shooting in 29 minutes going 5/12 from three. This is a season high for Knox in points and the 29 minutes were nice to see
* Mitchell Robinson had a solid game for NYK with a 12 point 11 rebound double-double on 5/5 shooting and had 2 steals and 2 blocks in the losing effort for the Knicks
* Dillon Brooks lead the Grizzlies to a win behind 21 points, 7 boards and 3 assists on 6/15 shooting in 33 minutes. It really is crazy how much more exciting Ja makes this team, without him they are just so less explosive. Clarke looked decent out there again with 15 points and 4 boards on 6/15 shooting in 29 minutes while Anderson filled the sheet with 8/6/9 in 30 minutes
* Andre Drummond put up another double double with 19 points and 14 rebounds in a game where Sexton was supposed to return, but was scratched late yet again as the Cavs are starting to need his return badly as they have dropped 4 out of their past 5 games.
* While he won't be in the Rookie Report, Isiah Joe had another solid game in the absence of starters for the 76ers with 18 points off the bench on 6/9 shooting and 4/7 from three in 27 minutes. He certainly will not be seeing this opportunity when the 76ers have their team back
* Carmelo Anthony looked fresh for the Blazers in the win with 20 points and 5 boards and 3 assists on 6/14 shooting with 2 steals and 2 blocks in 35 minutes. This is Carmelo's season high in points and minutes and was great to see the former star look good last night hitting some clutch shots for Portland in the win. Jusuf Nurkic went down for the Blazers last night with a quad injury, and it seemed like Anthony took the bulk of his minutes, while Kanter saw 15 minutes and put up 14 points and 6 boards. Carmelo's value may increase without Nurk.
* Chris Boucher continues to play well for Toronto and I would really assume he enters the starting lineup sooner than later for this struggling team. Boucher put up 20 points and 8 boards on 7/12 shooting and 5/8 from three to go along with 3 blocks. Boucher's rebounding, shooting, and blocking ability make him a really attractive fantasy piece if he is given proper minutes. He was playing down the stretch and hit two threes late in the fourth which is encouraging going forward

&amp;#x200B;

Rookie Report

* LaMelo Ball
   * Ball continues to stuff the stat sheet with a 8/14/7 line on 3/13 shooting though in 29 minutes. His shooting may continue to be somewhat of a concern but LaMelo is doing too much to be left on your bench at this point. He continues to prove himself this season as one of the if not the best rookies in this class
* Cole Anthony
   * Anthony continues to struggle with his shot and is certainly trending downwards at this point. He played 23 minutes with 12 points with 3 rebounds and 1 assist on 4/13 shooting and 1/4 from three. Anthony needs to prove more soon to show that he has value in his rookie season
* Tyrese Haliburton
   * Haliburton reverted back to the bench in this one but still saw 28 minutes and put up a 12/3/4 line on 4/8 shooting and 3/6 from three. He continues to play strong for the Kings early on and is playing pretty consistent with 6 straight double digit games and today marked his sixth straight game with at least one steal
* Deni Avdija
   * Deni only played 19 minutes in the win over Phoenix which is a bit suprising considering he had been seeing heavy minutes without Westbrook in the line up. He had a 6/5/1 line on 3/6 shooting and is not someone you can trust to start right now.
* Isaac Okoro
   * Okoro continues to see heavy minutes for the Cavs with their injuries with a 12/2/1 stat line in a team high 39 minutes on 5/11 shooting and snagging 3 steals. Okoro is not playing bad basketball by any means, as he does look like he belongs in this league, but his numbers do not translate well to good fantasy stats this season
* Desmond Bane
   * Bane continues to be a solid contributor for Memphis off the bench with 9 points on 4/5 shooting to go with 4 rebounds and 2 assists in 20 minutes. He is not someone you can trust right now, but he has been solid for Memphis this season. If something were to happen to Brooks or Anderson his value would for sure increase
* Tyrese Maxey
   * Maxey looked solid again for the 76ers, while it wasn't 39 points this team he put up a 15/6/4 line on 7/14 shooting in 30 minutes. I am going to be very interested to see how Maxey fits into the regular rotation going forward for the 76ers.

Stud of the Night: Bradley Beal(34 points, 9 assists, 8 rebounds, 35 minutes, 12/22 shooting)

Dud of the Night: Deandre Ayton(8 points, 6 rebounds, 1 assist, 23 minutes, 4/10 shooting)

Rook of the Night: LaMelo Ball(8 points, 14 rebounds, 7 assists, 29 minutes, 3/13 shooting)

Quote of the Night: ""I'm a killer. Figure out ways to eat. That's what describes me. Sharks just go hunt. Don't worry about things. Never worry about how they get next meal. Don't worry about anything, that's how I live my life"" -CJ McCollum on his mentality

&amp;#x200B;

* Kings and Pacers Battle it Out in Sacremento
   * Harrison Barnes and De'Aaron Fox lead the Kings as Barnes poured in a season high 30 points on 10/14 shooting to go along with 8 boards in 37 minutes. Fox had 21 points with 5 boards and  9 assists on 7/19 shooting and iced the game for the Kings with this ridiculous dunk([https://twitter.com/WorldWideWob/status/1348863181058408448?s=20](https://twitter.com/WorldWideWob/status/1348863181058408448?s=20))
   * Sabonis continued his strong start to the season with 28 points, 11 rebounds and 3 assists on 12/21 shooting marking his second straight outing with 28 points, while Brogdon also continues his great start as well with a 24/4/9 line on 9/18 shooting in 37 minutes.
   * The Defenders were active in this game. While struggling with his shot going 2/11 from three although scoring 21 points, Victor Oladipo recorded 6 steals and Myles Turner had 2 steals and 3 blocks in the losing effort as well. Richaun Holmes played awesome in the win for the Kings as well with a 16 point and 10 board double double on 6/11 shooting and had a career high 6 blocks. Holmes continues to be a pretty awesome 9 cat player

&amp;#x200B;

* Beal and Booker Duel in Washington
   * Beal and the Wizards got the win over Phoenix without Westbrook with a 34/8/9 line on 12/22 shooting. Beal continues to be an absolute stud and even more so without Westbrook in the lineup. Beal's past three outings have been 60, 41, and 34 points. It was nice to see this one finally translate to a win for the Wizards
   * Devin Booker broke through for a season high 33 points on 11/21 shooting in 32 minutes in the loss to Washington. Chris Paul also played solid with a 14 point and 11 assist double double. This is back to back games with double digit assists for Paul as he is starting to find his groove in Phoenix

&amp;#x200B;

* Trae Young and Hawks End Skid vs Depleted 76ers
   * Trae Young finally got back to the Trae we were seeing earlier this season with 26 points on 9/19 shooting and 3/7 from three to go with 3 boards and 8 assists. This was all in 25 minutes as the Hawks took a commanding lead in the 3rd and Trae sat the 4th. Pretty balanced effort bu the Hawks with every other starter reaching double points in the range of 10-15 points in the win for Atlanta.
   * Embiid was off to a very hot start in this game, but the 76ers couldn't keep up with Atlanta and he only played 22 minutes, but finished with a 24 point 11 rebound double-double on 8/17 shooting. He continues to play at an elite level this season and should certainly be seeing more than 22 minutes going forward

&amp;#x200B;

* Raptors Choke One Away to CJ and the Blazers
   * Yeah you read that title right, again it was not Dame and the Blazers, but it is CJ McCollum who continues to impress this season with a 30/6/5 line on 10/19 shooting and 5/11 from three in 38 minutes including a tough go ahead shot in the final seconds of the game. CJ is playing at an All-Star level this season with a career high 28 points per game, while Dame also had a solid showing for Portland with 23 points, 7 rebounds and 5 assists on 8/16 shooting in the win, although he racked up 8 turnovers
   * Pascal Siakam was awesome in the loss with his first career triple double on a 22/13/10 line in 36 minutes on 9/17 shooting. OG and Lowry also played solid for the Raptors with 18 a piece for the squad, but still they could not find a way to get the win and have fallen to 2-8 on the season. I do not think anyone in the world would have predicted 10 games into the season, the Raptors are tied with the Pistons for the worst record in the league

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Quick Hitters

* Giannis had a solid game with 22 points with 6 boards and 4 assists on 8/16 shooting with a steal and two blocks, while Middleton also was solid with 20/10/3 on 9/17 shooting as the Bucks took over to beat the Magic in the fourth.
* Bobby Portis put up another solid outing in the win with 20 points and 5 rebounds on 9/13 shooting in 24 minutes. He is a solid player to add as he does have lots of value when Giannis is out and it is encouraging to see him play well with Giannis in
* Nikola Vuceciv continues to play at a career best level in Orlando with a 28/13/5 line in the loss to the Bucks on 11/25 shooting. Vuc continues to be a stud for the Magic, while Aaron Gordo also stuffed the sheet a little bit with a 21/5/8 line on 8/14 shooting including a monster dunk over Giannis
* Buddy Hield dropped 18 points on 6/11 shooting all from beyond the arc while adding 4 boards and 3 assists as well in the win while drilling some clutch three pointers in the fourth
* Doug McDermott had an efficient 21 points on 8/10 shooting and 3/5 from three in 29 minutes. McDermott and Holiday seem to be the only two relevant bench players for the Pacers at this moment
* Davis Bertans saw 24 minutes off the bench for Washington and scored 18 points all on threes on 6/10 shooting and 6/9 from three. This was a nice bounce back game for Bertans after his 0/4 outing from three in his last showing
* Robin Lopez put up an 11 point, 11 rebound double-double starting in the place of Bryant. He might have some solid value this season with the loss of Bryant for Washington
* Gordon Hayward continues to just be really damn good in Charlotte. This might be the best Gordon Hayward we have seen yet honestly with a 34/3/3 line on 11/17 shooting, 10/10 from the line and 2/2 from three. There was a lot of criticism on his contract, but the he's starting to prove people wrong as the Hornets won their fourth in a row
* Julius Randle came back down to earth today with a 11/5/5 line on 2/9 shooting and four turnovers in the loss to Charlotte, while Kevin Knox actually played really well with 19 points on 7/17 shooting in 29 minutes going 5/12 from three. This is a season high for Knox in points and the 29 minutes were nice to see
* Mitchell Robinson had a solid game for NYK with a 12 point 11 rebound double-double on 5/5 shooting and had 2 steals and 2 blocks in the losing effort for the Knicks
* Dillon Brooks lead the Grizzlies to a win behind 21 points, 7 boards and 3 assists on 6/15 shooting in 33 minutes. It really is crazy how much more exciting Ja makes this team, without him they are just so less explosive. Clarke looked decent out there again with 15 points and 4 boards on 6/15 shooting in 29 minutes while Anderson filled the sheet with 8/6/9 in 30 minutes
* Andre Drummond put up another double double with 19 points and 14 rebounds in a game where Sexton was supposed to return, but was scratched late yet again as the Cavs are starting to need his return badly as they have dropped 4 out of their past 5 games.
* While he won't be in the Rookie Report, Isiah Joe had another solid game in the absence of starters for the 76ers with 18 points off the bench on 6/9 shooting and 4/7 from three in 27 minutes. He certainly will not be seeing this opportunity when the 76ers have their team back
* Carmelo Anthony looked fresh for the Blazers in the win with 20 points and 5 boards and 3 assists on 6/14 shooting with 2 steals and 2 blocks in 35 minutes. This is Carmelo's season high in points and minutes and was great to see the former star look good last night hitting some clutch shots for Portland in the win. Jusuf Nurkic went down for the Blazers last night with a quad injury, and it seemed like Anthony took the bulk of his minutes, while Kanter saw 15 minutes and put up 14 points and 6 boards. Carmelo's value may increase without Nurk.
* Chris Boucher continues to play well for Toronto and I would really assume he enters the starting lineup sooner than later for this struggling team. Boucher put up 20 points and 8 boards on 7/12 shooting and 5/8 from three to go along with 3 blocks. Boucher's rebounding, shooting, and blocking ability make him a really attractive fantasy piece if he is given proper minutes. He was playing down the stretch and hit two threes late in the fourth which is encouraging going forward

Rookie Report

* LaMelo Ball
   * Ball continues to stuff the stat sheet with a 8/14/7 line on 3/13 shooting though in 29 minutes. His shooting may continue to be somewhat of a concern but LaMelo is doing too much to be left on your bench at this point. He continues to prove himself this season as one of the if not the best rookies in this class
* Cole Anthony
   * Anthony continues to struggle with his shot and is certainly trending downwards at this point. He played 23 minutes with 12 points with 3 rebounds and 1 assist on 4/13 shooting and 1/4 from three. Anthony needs to prove more soon to show that he has value in his rookie season
* Tyrese Haliburton
   * Haliburton reverted back to the bench in this one but still saw 28 minutes and put up a 12/3/4 line on 4/8 shooting and 3/6 from three. He continues to play strong for the Kings early on and is playing pretty consistent with 6 straight double digit games and today marked his sixth straight game with at least one steal
* Deni Avdija
   * Deni only played 19 minutes in the win over Phoenix which is a bit suprising considering he had been seeing heavy minutes without Westbrook in the line up. He had a 6/5/1 line on 3/6 shooting and is not someone you can trust to start right now.
* Isaac Okoro
   * Okoro continues to see heavy minutes for the Cavs with their injuries with a 12/2/1 stat line in a team high 39 minutes on 5/11 shooting and snagging 3 steals. Okoro is not playing bad basketball by any means, as he does look like he belongs in this league, but his numbers do not translate well to good fantasy stats this season
* Desmond Bane
   * Bane continues to be a solid contributor for Memphis off the bench with 9 points on 4/5 shooting to go with 4 rebounds and 2 assists in 20 minutes. He is not someone you can trust right now, but he has been solid for Memphis this season. If something were to happen to Brooks or Anderson his value would for sure increase
* Tyrese Maxey
   * Maxey looked solid again for the 76ers, while it wasn't 39 points this team he put up a 15/6/4 line on 7/14 shooting in 30 minutes. I am going to be very interested to see how Maxey fits into the regular rotation going forward for the 76ers.

Well it’s clear that throughout the playoffs Giannis was apprehensive to guard Jimmy Butler and did his “free safety” role. But AD locked down Jimmy Butler, Russell Westbrook, Jamal Murray, and Damian Lillard. He also wasn’t shabby on Jokic, Bam, or PJ Tucker.

AD is also the much smarter defender (Giannis has some of the lowest IQ I’ve ever seen)

**•** MJ dominating even after playing in college for 2 years shows show amazing he was right out of the gates. 

**•** Lebron is the only one with multiple seasons in the top 5.

**•** Luka is the youngest player to appear on the list.

**•** Brandon Ingram is on pace to be 13th all time this season, but he does deserve an asterisk as the season is still young. That’s some elite company he’s in as every one of those players panned out into superstars, so pelicans fans might have to start paying attention to BI and maybe even shift their focus onto his development.

**•** Davis, Paul, McGrady and MJ are the only ones to achieve this feat without making more than a 100 threes in their seasons.

nba,"Seems things have calmed down this season relative to last with five players averaging above 29. This season only Beal is averaging more than 29. **Beal is currently averaging an efficient 35, 6 more points than second place.** Do you think he keeps it up? Probably not, but he could end the season as the scoring leader. 

[The current scoring leaders are Beal (34.9), Curry (28.6), McCollum (28.1), Lavine (27.7), and Tatum (26.9).](https://www.nba.com/stats/leaders/) 

So who do you think the top scorers will be this season?

I think it'll be Beal, Curry, Doncic. Harden looks like he's coasting the season (and is still putting up an efficient 26 points 11 assists, insane). Beal was second in scoring last season only to Harden, so with Harden coasting I don't think it's unreasonable to say he'll win a scoring title this year. We've also seen Curry have insane scoring seasons before. Beal and Curry will have to put up a ton of points to carry their team on offense. Doncic put up 29 last season, is looking back to normal after a slow start, and might be gunning for the MVP. 

I think CJ and Lavine will settle in around 23-26 PPG after their hot starts. If the Blazers don't become a hospital, I think Dame will only need to put up ~27 PPG. Giannis likely won't be gunning for another MVP and will instead save his energy for the postseason. Harden is coasting. I think Trae ends as a top scorer and I think he has potential to overtake Doncic or Curry if the Hawks stay injured but I think he'll focus more on passing this year. Paul George is also a shout but I don't think he'll have the volume on the Clippers. **Edit to include: Durant hasn't played enough games to currently be on the scoring leaderboard. Forgot about him, but I expect him to be top 5. I just don't think he'll have to put up as many points as Beal or Curry, and the Nets offense doesn't completely revolve around him like the Mavs with Doncic.",t2_11o818,Predict the top 3 scorers this season.,t3_kvz50g,smashacc,20,"Predict the top 3 scorers this season.

nba,"The United States government has three branches -- executive, legislative, and judicial -- based on the concept of separation of powers and checks and [balances](https://www.politicalscienceview.com/balance-of-power/) against each other.

In some ways, a *basketball* government works the same way. The owner is ultimately in charge, but there are powerful figures in the **general manager**, **head coach,** and **star player.** In a sense, they all have checks and balances over each other. The GM can fire the coach or trade the star. The coach can bench the star. And the star can either leave town in free agency, or demand a trade outright. It's a delicate balance of power between the three branches.

But if push came to shove, which branch has the MOST power? It may depend on the specific team. So with that question in mind, let's make a ruling for each operation.

---

**ATLANTA HAWKS**

*GM* : Travis Schlenk

*coach* : Lloyd Pierce

*player* : Trae Young

*the buck stops with...*  Travis Schlenk drafted an All-Star in Trae Young, but whether that was a good or bad decision is still up for debate. In the meantime, his chosen one probably usurped him in terms of power with the organization. When you average near 30-10, that tends to be the case. PLAYER wins here.

---

**BOSTON CELTICS**

*GM* : Danny Ainge

*coach* : Brad Stevens

*player* : Jayson Tatum

*the buck stops with...*  This is a tough call (maybe our toughest of the whole exercise), because everyone in this triumvirate has significant juice. In most organizations, a young star would have the ultimate power, but the Celtics tend to operate more traditionally than that. The franchise itself has more esteem than any one player. Of the two suits, I'll lean to the COACH here because he's younger and because Danny Ainge has finally started to get some flak from the fan base. And remember, if the team did have a falling out with Jayson Tatum, they wouldn't just cut him; they'd get back a very strong trade return (and Celtics fans could claim they liked Jaylen Brown better all along.) 

---

**BROOKLYN NETS**

*GM* : Sean Marks

*coach* : Steve Nash

*player* : Kevin Durant

*the buck stops with...*  GM Sean Marks build this contender from the ground up, in one of the more impressive rebuilds in modern sports history. But in a way, he sealed his own fate; he built the car, but then handed the keys off to superstars to take it from there. Kevin Durant may be 32, and he may be coming off injury, but he's still a top 5 player and one of the best of all-time. PLAYER wins again here.

---

**CHARLOTTE HORNETS**

*GM* : Mitch Kupchak

*coach* : James Borrego

*player* : LaMelo Ball (or Gordon Hayward)

*the buck stops with...*  We're not suggesting that LaMelo Ball is the best player on the roster yet, but he's the one with the most upside on the team and thus the most leverage here. In fact, he easily outpaces Mitch Kupchak and James Borrego, neither of whom have strong job security. PLAYER for the win.

---

**CHICAGO BULLS**

*GM* : Arturas Karnisovas

*coach* : Billy Donovan

*player* : Zach LaVine

*the buck stops with...*  Super scorer Zach LaVine may still be underrated by the national media, but his stats continue to outpace his street cred and leverage. In contrast, both GM and Coach have good resumes overall. The Reinsdorfs tend to have a traditional top-down hierarchy (Karnisovas hired Donovan, remember) so I'd presume the same goes for any power struggles. GM wins this battle.

---

**CLEVELAND CAVALIERS**

*GM* : Koby Altman

*coach* : J.B. Bickerstaff

*player* : Collin Sexton

*the buck stops with...*  The Cavaliers are off to a surprising solid start, but it's far too premature to claim any of these three have generated a lot of power with it. If they all went to ownership and demanded power, I'd lean to GM here. Koby Altman has predated the other two, so let's go GM by a hair.

---

**DALLAS MAVERICKS**

*GM* : Donnie Nelson

*coach* : Rick Carlisle

*player* : Luka Doncic

*the buck stops with...*  Donnie Nelson and Rick Carlisle have built an incredible infrastructure in Dallas and have a title ring to show for it, but the NBA tends to be a *forward* looking league. And as a result, it's nearly impossible to beat the superstar whose barely old enough to drink (at age 21.) PLAYER again here.

---

**DENVER NUGGETS**

*GM* : Tim Connelly (president of basketball operations)

*coach* : Mike Malone

*player* : Nikola Jokic

*the buck stops with...*  The Denver Nuggets' front office deserves a lot of credit for their success, but it's still not the most rock solid organization. Tim Connelly has been discussed for other jobs recently, and his partner-in-crime Arturas Karnisovas left for Chicago. Overall, if push came to shove, I'd bet on the burly big man Nikola Jokic. PLAYER for another win.

---

**DETROIT PISTONS**

*GM* : Troy Weaver

*coach* : Dwane Casey

*player* : Killian Hayes (or Blake Griffin or Jerami Grant)

*the buck stops with...*  Troy Weaver came over to Detroit with a great pedigree in the OKC organization, but the early returns have been shaky at best. Still, the keyword here is *early.* A recently hired GM will win out over a veteran coach most days, including this day. GM wins this round.

---

**GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS**

*GM* : Bob Myers

*coach* : Steve Kerr

*player* : Steph Curry

*the buck stops with...*  Bob Myers and Steve Kerr are two of the best in the game, but Steph Curry is one of the best of all time. He has so much goodwill here in the Bay that Myers and Kerr would likely fall on the sword themselves rather than displace him. PLAYER wins.

---

**HOUSTON ROCKETS**

*GM* : Rafael Stone

*coach* : Stephen Silas

*player* : James Harden

*the buck stops with...*  In theory, James Harden should be given the same respect and leverage that other superstars have. In reality, he's lost that. His disgruntled attitude makes the team nervous that they'd lose him in a year or two, which hurts his ability to control the roster and coaching staff. In turn, Rafael Stone appears to have enough power to trade him (or not.) GM with the upset win.

---

**INDIANA PACERS**

*GM* : Kevin Pritchard (president of basketball operations)

*coach* : Nate Bjorkgren

*player* : Domatas Sabonis (or Victor Oladipo or Malcolm Brogdon)

*the buck stops with...*  Nate Bjorkgren has a promising start with the team, which is chocked full of good players. *Good* players, not great. I don't think any of them could push out the current front office structure, including an exec in Kevin Pritchard that has been there for years. GM gets another win, their 5th overall so far.

---

**LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS**

*GM* : Lawrence Frank (team president)

*coach* : Tyronn Lue

*player* : Kawhi Leonard

*the buck stops with...*  Coach Tyronn Lue has a fat new contract and some (theoretical) leverage, but it's not like Steve Ballmer would balk about paying off that salary if need be. For Ballmer, superstars like Kawhi Leonard are harder to come by than a few millions here and there. PLAYER is on top of the food chain here.

---

**LOS ANGELES LAKERS**

*GM* : Rob Pelinka

*coach* : Frank Vogel

*player* : LeBron James

*the buck stops with...*  Speaking of food chains, LeBron James may be our apex predator. The Lakers have done a solid job rebuilding the franchise, but LeBron James could fire the GM, LeBron James could fire the coach. Hell, LeBron James could probably fire Adam Silver as commissioner if he really wanted.

---

**MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES**

*GM* : Jason Wexler (team president)

*coach* : Taylor Jenkins

*player* : Ja Morant

*the buck stops with...*  Another tough call. Owner Robert Pera likes forward-thinking and smart executives like Jason Wexler and Zach Kleiman, who in turn hired Wharton-grad Taylor Jenkins. I imagine Pera would want to side with that braintrust in a power struggle, but the realities of the small market are at play here. If the team tried to trade a Rookie of the Year with a future as a bright as Ja Morant, there may be a viking-led sieging of the gate. Let's go PLAYER again here.

---

**MIAMI HEAT**

*GM* : Pat Riley (team president)

*coach* : Erik Spoelstra

*player* : Jimmy Butler

*the buck stops with...*  Pat Riley may be the ""Godfather,"" but eventually that ring needs to pass down to Michael Corleane. The same applies here, as Erik Spoelstra (age 50) seems to be more a part of the long-term future than Riley (age 75.) I suspect Spoelstra will rise up to a godfather role of his own, a la Gregg Popovich in San Antonio.

---

**MILWAUKEE BUCKS**

*GM* : Jon Horst

*coach* : Mike Budenholzer

*player* : Giannis Antetokounmpo

*the buck stops with...*  The Greek Freak has 2 MVPs and a new contract. And, he's still only 26 years old. You're not displacing him. PLAYER is an obvious answer here.

---

**MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES**

*GM* : Gersson Rosas (president of basketball operations)

*coach* : Ryan Saunders

*player* : Karl-Anthony Towns

*the buck stops with...*  We can rule out young Ryan Saunders, who amounts to the puppy dog curling up to his owner's feet. The decision between Gersson Rosas and KAT is more difficult. There's been some talk about trading Towns, but I don't know if Rosas has built up enough leverage to pull the trigger on that. He's made some big moves, but nothing that has cemented his grasp as the next great GM yet. Overall, we'll lean back on PLAYER.

---

**NEW ORLEANS PELICANS**

*GM* : David Griffin (EVP of basketball operations)

*coach* : Stan Van Gundy

*player* : Zion Williamson (or Brandon Ingram)

*the buck stops with...*  As much as the media loves David Griffin, I don't see him in contention here. The franchise could hand the front office over to GM Trajan Langdon and not miss a beat. In fact, the bigger debate to me here may be Zion Williamson vs. an always-improving Brandon Ingram. I'd lean to Zion, and either case it'd be PLAYER winning out here.

---

**NEW YORK KNICKS**

*GM* : Leon Rose (team president)

*coach* : Tom Thibodeau

*player* : R.J. Barrett (or Julius Randle)

*the buck stops with...*  The decision here comes down to Tom Thibodeau or the man who hired in him in Leon Rose. Thibs has the support of the fanbase right now, but Rose and CAA are embedded into the franchise's psyche. Given that, I'll go with Rose and the GM.

---

**OKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER**

*GM* : Sam Presti

*coach* : Mark Daigneault

*player* : Shai Gilgeous-Alexander

*the buck stops with...*  The GMs get another victory thanks to one of the most PRESTI-gious execs in the league. Meanwhile, Mark Daigneault is just happy that we spelled his name correctly.

---

**ORLANDO MAGIC**

*GM* : John Hammond

*coach* : Steve Clifford

*player* : Nikola Vucevic (or Jon Isaac)

*the buck stops with...*  I don't know if ANY of these figures has a huge amount of leverage in the organization, but I'll fall back on John Hammond and the GM here. It's a debate between him and coach Steve Clifford, especially since their contracts have the same length (2 years left on the deal.) Meanwhile, Jon Isaac's injury hurts him from contending here.

---

**PHILADELPHIA 76ers**

*GM* : Daryl Morey (president of basketball operations)

*coach* : Doc Rivers

*player* : Joel Embiid (or Ben Simmons)

*the buck stops with...*  We're dealing with some heavy hitters here, but the legend of Daryl Morey packs a punch. His salary is enormous for a team executive, which indicates how much weight he carries in the room. The GMs continue their streak here.

---

**PHOENIX SUNS**

*GM* : James Jones

*coach* : Monty Williams

*player* : Devin Booker

*the buck stops with...*  The steak is broken here, as this battle becomes a matter of coach vs. player. Devin Booker is a surging young star, but Monty Williams has done a great job himself in improving the culture. I'm going to lean to COACH here; Monty Williams has the gravitas and front office experience to become a major power player with this organization over time.

---

**PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS**

*GM* : Neil Olshey

*coach* : Terry Stotts

*player* : Damian Lillard

*the buck stops with...*  Let's not waste time here. Dame. PLAYER.

---

**SACRAMENTO KINGS**

*GM* : Monte McNair

*coach* : Luke Walton

*player* : De'Aaron Fox

*the buck stops with...*  This one won't be as easy. We can rule Luke Walton out, but new GM Monte McNair represents a legitimate challenge to De'Aaron Fox. McNair is a very bright exec with a good pedigree; I suspect he has Vivek Ranadive's ear. If he demanded to trade Fox, I think he'd have the power to do that now, even after giving Fox a big extension.

---

**SAN ANTONIO SPURS**

*GM* : R.C. Buford

*coach* : Gregg Popovich

*player* : DeMar DeRozan (?)

*the buck stops with...*  It's been a while since the coaches won a round, but Gregg Popovich is here to change that. He may be 71 and he may be nearing the end, but he'll reign over this kingdom as long as he wants.

---

**TORONTO RAPTORS**

*GM* : Masai Ujiri (team president)

*coach* : Nick Nurse

*player* : Pascal Siakam (or Fred VanVleet)

*the buck stops with...*  Nick Nurse is as good of a coach as anyone in the NBA, but Masai Ujiri may still be on a higher plane. If he ever become a ""free agent,"" he'd likely become the highest paid exec in the league. GM wins.

---

**UTAH JAZZ**

*GM* : Dennis Lindsey

*coach* : Quin Snyder

*player* : Donovan Mitchell (or Rudy Gobert)

*the buck stops with...*  Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert are both All-Star caliber players, but my instinct is to lean to the organization here. And if we do that, we should probably reward the front office that *landed* those two studs on draft day. GM wins here, although Quin Snyder has a legitimate argument himself.

---

**WASHINGTON WIZARDS**

*GM* : Tommy Sheppard

*coach* : Scottie Brooks

*player* : Bradley Beal

*the buck stops with...*  This is another difficult one, for different reasons. All three of these gentlemen may be gone by next year. Heck, Scottie Brooks may be gone by the time you finish reading this post. I'm going to go with GM here given the context. The Wizards may be starting to realize that ""competing"" is too hard given the holes on the roster and that a Bradley Beal trade may be inevitable. If Sheppard wanted to trade Beal to facilitate a rebuild, I suspect he'd have the greenlight.

---

**OVERALL SCOREBOARD**

*GM* : 14

*COACH* : 4 

*PLAYER* : 12

*the buck stops with...*  The front office surprisingly won this count, although it's nearly dead even with the superstar player and could have gone either way. Meanwhile, poor coaches are bringing up the rear. In fact, a few of those coach wins were debatable; Gregg Popovich is probably the only coach with a clear mandate of power in his organization.",t2_wylwx,[OC] BALANCE of POWER: which branch of your team's basketball government has the most authority?,t3_kvtb4e,ZandrickEllison,22,"[OC] BALANCE of POWER: which branch of your team's basketball government has the most authority? The United States government has three branches -- executive, legislative, and judicial -- based on the concept of separation of powers and checks and [balances](https://www.politicalscienceview.com/balance-of-power/) against each other.

In some ways, a *basketball* government works the same way. The owner is ultimately in charge, but there are powerful figures in the **general manager**, **head coach,** and **star player.** In a sense, they all have checks and balances over each other. The GM can fire the coach or trade the star. The coach can bench the star. And the star can either leave town in free agency, or demand a trade outright. It's a delicate balance of power between the three branches.

But if push came to shove, which branch has the MOST power? It may depend on the specific team. So with that question in mind, let's make a ruling for each operation.

---

**ATLANTA HAWKS**

*GM* : Travis Schlenk

*coach* : Lloyd Pierce

*player* : Trae Young

*the buck stops with...*  Travis Schlenk drafted an All-Star in Trae Young, but whether that was a good or bad decision is still up for debate. In the meantime, his chosen one probably usurped him in terms of power with the organization. When you average near 30-10, that tends to be the case. PLAYER wins here.

---

**BOSTON CELTICS**

*GM* : Danny Ainge

*coach* : Brad Stevens

*player* : Jayson Tatum

*the buck stops with...*  This is a tough call (maybe our toughest of the whole exercise), because everyone in this triumvirate has significant juice. In most organizations, a young star would have the ultimate power, but the Celtics tend to operate more traditionally than that. The franchise itself has more esteem than any one player. Of the two suits, I'll lean to the COACH here because he's younger and because Danny Ainge has finally started to get some flak from the fan base. And remember, if the team did have a falling out with Jayson Tatum, they wouldn't just cut him; they'd get back a very strong trade return (and Celtics fans could claim they liked Jaylen Brown better all along.) 

---

**BROOKLYN NETS**

*GM* : Sean Marks

*coach* : Steve Nash

*player* : Kevin Durant

*the buck stops with...*  GM Sean Marks build this contender from the ground up, in one of the more impressive rebuilds in modern sports history. But in a way, he sealed his own fate; he built the car, but then handed the keys off to superstars to take it from there. Kevin Durant may be 32, and he may be coming off injury, but he's still a top 5 player and one of the best of all-time. PLAYER wins again here.

---

**CHARLOTTE HORNETS**

*GM* : Mitch Kupchak

*coach* : James Borrego

*player* : LaMelo Ball (or Gordon Hayward)

*the buck stops with...*  We're not suggesting that LaMelo Ball is the best player on the roster yet, but he's the one with the most upside on the team and thus the most leverage here. In fact, he easily outpaces Mitch Kupchak and James Borrego, neither of whom have strong job security. PLAYER for the win.

---

**CHICAGO BULLS**

*GM* : Arturas Karnisovas

*coach* : Billy Donovan

*player* : Zach LaVine

*the buck stops with...*  Super scorer Zach LaVine may still be underrated by the national media, but his stats continue to outpace his street cred and leverage. In contrast, both GM and Coach have good resumes overall. The Reinsdorfs tend to have a traditional top-down hierarchy (Karnisovas hired Donovan, remember) so I'd presume the same goes for any power struggles. GM wins this battle.

---

**CLEVELAND CAVALIERS**

*GM* : Koby Altman

*coach* : J.B. Bickerstaff

*player* : Collin Sexton

*the buck stops with...*  The Cavaliers are off to a surprising solid start, but it's far too premature to claim any of these three have generated a lot of power with it. If they all went to ownership and demanded power, I'd lean to GM here. Koby Altman has predated the other two, so let's go GM by a hair.

---

**DALLAS MAVERICKS**

*GM* : Donnie Nelson

*coach* : Rick Carlisle

*player* : Luka Doncic

*the buck stops with...*  Donnie Nelson and Rick Carlisle have built an incredible infrastructure in Dallas and have a title ring to show for it, but the NBA tends to be a *forward* looking league. And as a result, it's nearly impossible to beat the superstar whose barely old enough to drink (at age 21.) PLAYER again here.

---

**DENVER NUGGETS**

*GM* : Tim Connelly (president of basketball operations)

*coach* : Mike Malone

*player* : Nikola Jokic

*the buck stops with...*  The Denver Nuggets' front office deserves a lot of credit for their success, but it's still not the most rock solid organization. Tim Connelly has been discussed for other jobs recently, and his partner-in-crime Arturas Karnisovas left for Chicago. Overall, if push came to shove, I'd bet on the burly big man Nikola Jokic. PLAYER for another win.

---

**DETROIT PISTONS**

*GM* : Troy Weaver

*coach* : Dwane Casey

*player* : Killian Hayes (or Blake Griffin or Jerami Grant)

*the buck stops with...*  Troy Weaver came over to Detroit with a great pedigree in the OKC organization, but the early returns have been shaky at best. Still, the keyword here is *early.* A recently hired GM will win out over a veteran coach most days, including this day. GM wins this round.

---

**GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS**

*GM* : Bob Myers

*coach* : Steve Kerr

*player* : Steph Curry

*the buck stops with...*  Bob Myers and Steve Kerr are two of the best in the game, but Steph Curry is one of the best of all time. He has so much goodwill here in the Bay that Myers and Kerr would likely fall on the sword themselves rather than displace him. PLAYER wins.

---

**HOUSTON ROCKETS**

*GM* : Rafael Stone

*coach* : Stephen Silas

*player* : James Harden

*the buck stops with...*  In theory, James Harden should be given the same respect and leverage that other superstars have. In reality, he's lost that. His disgruntled attitude makes the team nervous that they'd lose him in a year or two, which hurts his ability to control the roster and coaching staff. In turn, Rafael Stone appears to have enough power to trade him (or not.) GM with the upset win.

---

**INDIANA PACERS**

*GM* : Kevin Pritchard (president of basketball operations)

*coach* : Nate Bjorkgren

*player* : Domatas Sabonis (or Victor Oladipo or Malcolm Brogdon)

*the buck stops with...*  Nate Bjorkgren has a promising start with the team, which is chocked full of good players. *Good* players, not great. I don't think any of them could push out the current front office structure, including an exec in Kevin Pritchard that has been there for years. GM gets another win, their 5th overall so far.

---

**LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS**

*GM* : Lawrence Frank (team president)

*coach* : Tyronn Lue

*player* : Kawhi Leonard

*the buck stops with...*  Coach Tyronn Lue has a fat new contract and some (theoretical) leverage, but it's not like Steve Ballmer would balk about paying off that salary if need be. For Ballmer, superstars like Kawhi Leonard are harder to come by than a few millions here and there. PLAYER is on top of the food chain here.

---

**LOS ANGELES LAKERS**

*GM* : Rob Pelinka

*coach* : Frank Vogel

*player* : LeBron James

*the buck stops with...*  Speaking of food chains, LeBron James may be our apex predator. The Lakers have done a solid job rebuilding the franchise, but LeBron James could fire the GM, LeBron James could fire the coach. Hell, LeBron James could probably fire Adam Silver as commissioner if he really wanted.

---

**MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES**

*GM* : Jason Wexler (team president)

*coach* : Taylor Jenkins

*player* : Ja Morant

*the buck stops with...*  Another tough call. Owner Robert Pera likes forward-thinking and smart executives like Jason Wexler and Zach Kleiman, who in turn hired Wharton-grad Taylor Jenkins. I imagine Pera would want to side with that braintrust in a power struggle, but the realities of the small market are at play here. If the team tried to trade a Rookie of the Year with a future as a bright as Ja Morant, there may be a viking-led sieging of the gate. Let's go PLAYER again here.

---

**MIAMI HEAT**

*GM* : Pat Riley (team president)

*coach* : Erik Spoelstra

*player* : Jimmy Butler

*the buck stops with...*  Pat Riley may be the ""Godfather,"" but eventually that ring needs to pass down to Michael Corleane. The same applies here, as Erik Spoelstra (age 50) seems to be more a part of the long-term future than Riley (age 75.) I suspect Spoelstra will rise up to a godfather role of his own, a la Gregg Popovich in San Antonio.

---

**MILWAUKEE BUCKS**

*GM* : Jon Horst

*coach* : Mike Budenholzer

*player* : Giannis Antetokounmpo

*the buck stops with...*  The Greek Freak has 2 MVPs and a new contract. And, he's still only 26 years old. You're not displacing him. PLAYER is an obvious answer here.

---

**MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES**

*GM* : Gersson Rosas (president of basketball operations)

*coach* : Ryan Saunders

*player* : Karl-Anthony Towns

*the buck stops with...*  We can rule out young Ryan Saunders, who amounts to the puppy dog curling up to his owner's feet. The decision between Gersson Rosas and KAT is more difficult. There's been some talk about trading Towns, but I don't know if Rosas has built up enough leverage to pull the trigger on that. He's made some big moves, but nothing that has cemented his grasp as the next great GM yet. Overall, we'll lean back on PLAYER.

---

**NEW ORLEANS PELICANS**

*GM* : David Griffin (EVP of basketball operations)

*coach* : Stan Van Gundy

*player* : Zion Williamson (or Brandon Ingram)

*the buck stops with...*  As much as the media loves David Griffin, I don't see him in contention here. The franchise could hand the front office over to GM Trajan Langdon and not miss a beat. In fact, the bigger debate to me here may be Zion Williamson vs. an always-improving Brandon Ingram. I'd lean to Zion, and either case it'd be PLAYER winning out here.

---

**NEW YORK KNICKS**

*GM* : Leon Rose (team president)

*coach* : Tom Thibodeau

*player* : R.J. Barrett (or Julius Randle)

*the buck stops with...*  The decision here comes down to Tom Thibodeau or the man who hired in him in Leon Rose. Thibs has the support of the fanbase right now, but Rose and CAA are embedded into the franchise's psyche. Given that, I'll go with Rose and the GM.

---

**OKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER**

*GM* : Sam Presti

*coach* : Mark Daigneault

*player* : Shai Gilgeous-Alexander

*the buck stops with...*  The GMs get another victory thanks to one of the most PRESTI-gious execs in the league. Meanwhile, Mark Daigneault is just happy that we spelled his name correctly.

---

**ORLANDO MAGIC**

*GM* : John Hammond

*coach* : Steve Clifford

*player* : Nikola Vucevic (or Jon Isaac)

*the buck stops with...*  I don't know if ANY of these figures has a huge amount of leverage in the organization, but I'll fall back on John Hammond and the GM here. It's a debate between him and coach Steve Clifford, especially since their contracts have the same length (2 years left on the deal.) Meanwhile, Jon Isaac's injury hurts him from contending here.

---

**PHILADELPHIA 76ers**

*GM* : Daryl Morey (president of basketball operations)

*coach* : Doc Rivers

*player* : Joel Embiid (or Ben Simmons)

*the buck stops with...*  We're dealing with some heavy hitters here, but the legend of Daryl Morey packs a punch. His salary is enormous for a team executive, which indicates how much weight he carries in the room. The GMs continue their streak here.

---

**PHOENIX SUNS**

*GM* : James Jones

*coach* : Monty Williams

*player* : Devin Booker

*the buck stops with...*  The steak is broken here, as this battle becomes a matter of coach vs. player. Devin Booker is a surging young star, but Monty Williams has done a great job himself in improving the culture. I'm going to lean to COACH here; Monty Williams has the gravitas and front office experience to become a major power player with this organization over time.

---

**PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS**

*GM* : Neil Olshey

*coach* : Terry Stotts

*player* : Damian Lillard

*the buck stops with...*  Let's not waste time here. Dame. PLAYER.

---

**SACRAMENTO KINGS**

*GM* : Monte McNair

*coach* : Luke Walton

*player* : De'Aaron Fox

*the buck stops with...*  This one won't be as easy. We can rule Luke Walton out, but new GM Monte McNair represents a legitimate challenge to De'Aaron Fox. McNair is a very bright exec with a good pedigree; I suspect he has Vivek Ranadive's ear. If he demanded to trade Fox, I think he'd have the power to do that now, even after giving Fox a big extension.

---

**SAN ANTONIO SPURS**

*GM* : R.C. Buford

*coach* : Gregg Popovich

*player* : DeMar DeRozan (?)

*the buck stops with...*  It's been a while since the coaches won a round, but Gregg Popovich is here to change that. He may be 71 and he may be nearing the end, but he'll reign over this kingdom as long as he wants.

---

**TORONTO RAPTORS**

*GM* : Masai Ujiri (team president)

*coach* : Nick Nurse

*player* : Pascal Siakam (or Fred VanVleet)

*the buck stops with...*  Nick Nurse is as good of a coach as anyone in the NBA, but Masai Ujiri may still be on a higher plane. If he ever become a ""free agent,"" he'd likely become the highest paid exec in the league. GM wins.

---

nba,"COVID cases are skyrocketing and the league is reportedly discussing a two week break. Personally, I don’t understand how a two week pause to the season would make a noticeable difference. From everything I’ve seen, two weeks doesn’t seem long enough for the league to get access to vaccines. 

What does make sense to me, would be if the NBA used the two week break to move the rest of the season Australia or New Zealand.  As far as I know, Australia currently has a very low case count, because they require all travelers to quarantine for two weeks before entering the country. 

The Orlando bubble was obviously very difficult on players and coaches, because they cannot spend time with their family’s. It seems that moving to Australia would be easier on the league because players and coaches could bring their families with them. 

One negative would be the cost, but it seems like the league would lose more money if teams have to keep delaying/cancelling games. The NBA could also use the courts and facilities owned by NBL in Australia.

This was a [130-120 loss to the Magic in the second game of the season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202012260WAS.html). 

The Wizards had an awful stretch to start the season, losing twice to the Magic and Bulls at home. But other than those four games, they've been performing pretty adequately. 

Two close road losses to a great home team in the Sixers, another loss on the road to a top Eastern team in the Celtics, a hard-fought SEGABABA loss to the Heat at home without Beal, a blowout vs the KAT-less Wolves, a road win vs the Nets, and a blowout home win vs the Suns.  

It's arguable coaching decisions lost us the games against the Magic and Bulls, in particular the blown fourth quarters against the Magic. If we won two or three of those very winnable games, we'd be right around 0.500 and I wonder how loud the ""trade Beal"" talk would be.

Looking at how close literally all of our losses have been, I wonder what record we would have with not even an elite coach like Pop, but just a solid coach like Doc or D'Antoni. 

Can't be stated enough how awful Brooks is. I swear he's coaching our guys to never help out on drives and we wouldn't be a bottom 10 defense with someone else. He also seems to have almost no offensive set plays and is misusing almost all of our players. Why is Beal playing so much hero ball when he's amazing off-ball and we have Russ and Deni as playmakers? Why isn't Russ playing in a 5-out with four shooters so he can attack the rim and why is he playing with Ish and Lopez? Why was Deni largely acting as a catch and shoot player when he's a great passer? Why were we trying to get an injured Bertans in rhythm with contested 30 foot threes? Why did half our team have to get injured before Bonga and Garrison Matthews got minutes? Why is Russ allowed to shoot 15 jumpshots a game?",t2_2l3xmyy0,The Wizards have yet to lose a game by more than 10.,t3_kvir9d,NBA_acc,23,"The Wizards have yet to lose a game by more than 10.

nba,"#Before people complain, he absolutely is looking only at the regular season. 

I've seen quite a few people call Harden a top 5 offensive player of all time. But I get the feeling this is being done to pump up the hype of a trade. He's a supremely talented offensive player no doubt but I think top 5 and even top 10 might be stretching it. 

When we're talking about the top 5 players in the league, I feel like they should be graded more heavily on their postseason performance. I think this is fair; Harden could take this Rockets team to the playoffs in the West with regular season heroics, but they're not beating the Lakers in the postseason. 

The goal for Harden and every other top 5-6 player is to win a championship, not to get the first seed. With that goal in mind, I think it's fair to weigh postseason performance more heavily when grading a superstar. The Sixers aren't considering trading for Harden because they think they'll get a higher regular season seed. They'll easily make the playoffs as is. They want Harden to compete with the firepower other duos in the league have. 

Harden is still great in the postseason no doubt. An efficient 28 points and 7 assists through his Houston tenure is nothing to sniff at. But **Lebron**, **Durant**, and **Curry** are all better offensive weapons in the postseason, and that's just among his currently active contemporaries. 

And off the top of my head, I'd take **Jordan**, **Shaq**, **Bird**, **Kobe** (fight me on this), and **Magic** over Harden as postseason offensive centerpieces. And that doesn't even include old school legendary centers like **Hakeem**, **Kareem**, and **Wilt** whose scoring prowess gets relatively underrated because they're big men. And old school guard legends like **Jerry West** or **Oscar Robertson** who also get forgotten because they're not top 11 players of all time like the three aforementioned big men. 

**Harden is a supremely talented player and will require a haul no, no doubt. But calling him a top 5 offensive force of all time feels like it's overrating him relative to the NBA's all-time greats.

nba,"In light of the recent James Harden trade, I headed over to the nets subreddit to read on people's thoughts about the trade, and I was shocked at what I found. A sizable number in the nets subreddit were saying they gave up too much, and one person even said that Jarret Allen should have been untouchable. Jarret Allen is a good young player, but he is not a fraction of the star james harden is. The reason the rockets got  so much for harden is because the trade STILL isn't fair value. A top 3 player in the NBA, especially a guard, does not need a great team around them to win games. Take lebron in 2018, literally dragging a terrible roster to the finals. And to win a chip, you NEED an abundance to superstar talent. The last team to win without a true top 5 player was the spurs in 2014, but it is the exception not the rule. Obviously harden is not as good as lebron, but harden is absolutely the right move considering you have 2 other stars in durant and irving. You cannot  expect Sean Marks to be sentimental about homegrown player, his job is to put the nets in the best position to win a chip. I'm not saying the nets will win, but they have a good shot. The concerns about bench depth and fit are overblown, especially since one of KD, Irving, and Harden will likely be on the floor at all times.",t2_iwdsn,You are overvaluing your homegrown players.

nba,"In light of the recent James Harden trade, I headed over to the nets subreddit to read on people's thoughts about the trade, and I was shocked at what I found. A sizable number in the nets subreddit were saying they gave up too much, and one person even said that Jarret Allen should have been untouchable. Jarret Allen is a good young player, but he is not a fraction of the star james harden is. The reason the rockets got  so much for harden is because the trade STILL isn't fair value. A top 3 player in the NBA, especially a guard, does not need a great team around them to win games. Take lebron in 2018, literally dragging a terrible roster to the finals. And to win a chip, you NEED an abundance to superstar talent. The last team to win without a true top 5 player was the spurs in 2014, but it is the exception not the rule. Obviously harden is not as good as lebron, but harden is absolutely the right move considering you have 2 other stars in durant and irving. You cannot  expect Sean Marks to be sentimental about homegrown players, his job is to put the nets in the best position to win a chip. I'm not saying the nets will win the title, but they have a good shot. The concerns about bench depth and fit are overblown, especially since one of KD, Irving, and Harden will likely be on the floor at all times.",t2_iwdsn,You are overvaluing your homegrown players.
